tBANVdxh_if10BXv6YsLmg,you know i probabl spent an inordin amount of time try to come up with a joke about the name of thi place that would refer a pleasur center in a bowl of soup but so far i m come up with noth oh well i ll just write a review about how good thi place i and leav the joke to the writer of lock my girlfriend had a silver ring which broke with a larg piec of lapi lazuli inset i found barn via help and decid to pop over for a visit to see what thei could do with it thei took the ring and said that thei d try to get the stone out and after that could creat a new ring for it from gold white gold or platinum i ask about silver and thei said that thei did nt work with it but could refer me to someon who doe so i left the ring with them and the next dai thei call me to let me know it wa readi i went by and thei d successfulli manag to remov the stone i pull out my credit card but there wa no charg i wa realli impress with their custom servic if you re in the market for some high jewelleri thi i definit the place for you thi place wa fantast yup i stand by my convict tri a new pizza from here and some boneless chicken tender a far a the chicken tender thei were

few more great date night thi place could easili get that extra star solid delici pho if i live closer i d probabl eat here a lot but it  a littl outsid of my area so i might not make it back for awhil wa nt abl to familiar myself with the menu overmuch but thei seem to present a solid menu of offer i d like to be abl to write more about it but all i can sai i that i had a great experi with a solid bowl and vietnames coffe servic wa prompt and attent so there ya go had a great experi here i wa immedi greet a soon a i pull up to the store by the friendli staff and talk to their servic depart wa a breez i told them what wa wrong thei said that thei d check it out and that wa that diagnos fixe charg a reason rate and after a short wait i wa on my wai everyon wa veri polit and profession stop by here todai to see where thei re locat and what thei ve got it  a veri small littl place and would be quit easi to miss on their websit thei give realli good direct and you have to

and i wa a fan of them there unabashedli hipsteresqu but that should nt stop you from stop by their food i damn good and even when thei re a littl busi thei have plenti of seat to accommod crowd their portion ar a littl on the smaller side but that wa nt a problem for me my meal wa larg enough to eat in on sit and not feel horribl but not realli larg enough to eat half of and take the rest home alright it  time to updat my review for thi place and i m veri happi to be abl to give them five star becaus honestli thei ve far surpass my hope and expect came here for dinner on night with my girlfriend and the ladi and i wa an extrem happi man i wa nt expect much mexican food in my area i pretti whitewash but thi wa actual the real deal it  fancier than your averag taco stand and their

ll find stuff here that will difficult if not imposs to find at most other place thei special in asia good but you ll find treat from the carribean and latin america a well their produc i stellar and even their select of alcohol i amaz four star but an easi five with anoth good experi thi place i a great altern to the option at sky harbor year the food i pricei year it  heavi on the belli year it take awhil for your order to be readi but in the end it  worth it i ve had their sandwich sever time and thei re alwai topnotch the pork belli i a bit heavi but if you have someon to split it with then it  just about perfect and their fri will knock your sock off but chanc ar you have a spare pair in your luggag so that should nt be a problem thi place realli ai nt bad matter of fact it  quit good the taco ar a littl on the small side but thei re definit two solidli delici bite i wish that there wa a bit more varieti boch chicharron or tripi but thei do have langu and cabeza and thei do what thei do realli well look like thei also have daili monodi so i ma have to see bout dat thi i the place that i ve dreamt of for oh long after the close of my belov made hous i wonder how ani restaur could ever fill the hole in my heart ladi and gentlemen i am so glad to announc that restaur ha come i got in i got out reason price friendli servic thi locat i also pretti conveni locat so that you can walk over to handa express while you wait and get your chines on if that  your thing order some wing and a meatza pizza tonight an hour and a half later i still had nt receiv my order so i call the restaur after a few minut i end up speak with the manag who wa extrem apologet and told me that thei d immedi make and deliveri the order and throw in a free twolit of soda i could nt stai mad at them the manag wa genuin apologet and realli want to make the situat right well i said that i d return and give thi place anoth shot so i did come to thi walmart i alwai a wonder experi thi

fish and shrimp ar fri to perfect and their burger have that styl that noth els can scratch the itch for all in all thi i a great place to swing by and have a tasti bite to eat the driver ar alwai friendli and their servic i extrem conveni just be sure to make a reserv sometim on the busier holidai thei fill up and thei wo nt valet park for you anymor thei us to but no longer alright so sure by now you ve seen that review for thi new restaur ar al over the place and there  a veri good reason for that thi i a brand new restaur and thei re have a rough time with it the waitstaff from what i can tell ar extrem new to the game our server todai said it wa her first dai and thei re get mob with custom we came here at just befor pm and the place quickli fill to capac now if you ve ever work a a server then you know that it i a fuck tough and thankless job and if you have nt ever work a a server then you can go fuck yourself and keep ani opinion of the job to yourself becaus you do nt get to comment so yeah most of the waitstaff ar young and brand new and ar have a tough time with the order it happen have some compass and understand you bourgeoisi twat thi place i noth short of amaz full disclosur i ve onli gotten deliveri servic from them but what an amaz servic it ha been i veri much look forward to visit their actual restaur but a far a deliveri it  definit some of the best i realli have to sai their food wa knockout good here i order the mixe kefta and it knock my sock off serious thi place i solid but you have to understand it  kaitenzushi you wo nt be enjoi fat piec of molten toro here nor will the unai be freshli broil succul delici but if you just want a quick sushi fix you could do a lot wors and i have to sai some of the thing that i tri were realli tasti the salmon nigh wa especi nice thi place genuin i a good a it get in mani wai i feel that sinc my last review thei ve genuin up their game significantli so it  time to rewrit and reevalu everyth so i ve decid that the servic here can be a shitti a thei want it to be becaus the food i fuck amaz came here thi morn and had their daili special walnutbanana pancak with bacon came here for a littl snackypoo and had an enjoy time their sushi i fine it  fine seem like thei special in roll which i nt realli my thing thei have a ton of varieti and i d imagin that peopl come here mostli for that reason came here for a consult last week and went through the full procedur todai got four wisdom teeth taken out i wa honestli a littl apprehens about it becaus on of my lower teeth wa veri close to the nerv canal in my jaw but a far a i can tell everyth went realli smoothli the entir offic staff i realli nice and took the time to explain everi aspect of both the procedur and the bill structur dr porter wa realli profession and had a pleasant demeanor a damn fine slice of ny pizza with a pretti decent list of top got deliveri from here todai it wa prompt the pizza wa tasti the price wa right and it  good for what it  good for ny pizza i nt my favorit but that wo nt stop me from give thi place a solid rate thei do what thei do and thei re do it well i give them prop for that how did thi littl gem slip under my radar thi place wa just fine on the closer edg of pretti good i m give it four star mostli becaus all of the onetwo star rate were written by idiot who should never have learn to us a keyboard in the first place serious anyon who call thi place overpr ne to reevalu their financi decis in life i m sorri but someon who work at mcdonald realli should nt have equal access to a

playa oh biscuit biscuit you purveyor of breakfast good the onli reason that i m not give thi place five star i becaus of the servic that  it that  the onli reason it  not that thei were rude at all thei were just your typic asia restauranteur indiffer inscrut and inattent thi i far from uncommon in mani restaur so i ca nt realli knock the point too much but that combin with the condit of the

i could give less of a shit about but i feel it necessari to point it out becaus i know that some peopl realli get turn off by that i dug thi place got a great deal from pricelin and i pretti much knew what to expect go in i ve staye at place like thi befor across the countri and i can definit sai that thi wa a veri pleasant experi everyon ha complain about the bed be hard but i did nt realli

washedout wisp of cloth that you might have expect at other place the setup of the place wa great it  just like have a littl studio apart even had a coffeemak and an iron board which i strang becom a rariti these dai their pho i good and thei have plenti of other authent offer a well if you re feel adventur thei have a few more vietnames dish such a the tasti beef stew with cook blood and pig knuckl not realli my thing but you should at least try it sometim you might just love it
