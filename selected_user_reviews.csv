Plqi4pG84PA_vBM8OfDPDg,"Bestellen is all kinds of awesome! If you ever decide to try to place, gather your friends and order the family style whole suckling pig (Min 8 people and 72 hours notice required) Drink are good and reasonably priced, and the food they serve are definitely meant to go with drinks. If you come here, come here with a bunch of friends to have a good time because it is casual place that can get loud quickly - don't come here on a date and expect intimate conversation time.  Super impressed with this place!  Wow where do I even begin? This event was definitely the best one I've attended so far! Not only was it for a great cause supporting the Children's Book Bank, there are also a ton of yummy food and drinks there! I absolutely love the concept of Pi Co - choose from a variety of fresh toppings and have your custom pizza made fresh right in front of you, watching it cook in the oven in under 90 seconds and have a pipping hot pizza ready to eat in no time. \"As a local, I have always avoided restaurants that are fairly close to hotels just on the basis that it \"\"might\"\" be an overpriced tourist trap The famous Pablo Japanese Cheesetarts have finally arrived in North America, and they chose Toronto to be the first city to open a store! It's easy to miss Cafe Neon given it's understated store front, but you shouldn't! And you'll be forgiven to think it is just a coffee shop when you walk in, but the secret here is that it is actually a great brunch spot with a decent amount of seats at the back that are not visible when you walk in. Nice, decent sized H-mart located at Yonge/Bloor. Very excited to finally have an H-mart location that is downtown instead of up north of the city. This is now a bakery that sells cheesetarts instead of matcha cakes! We went to Bar Buca for brunch on a Sunday. It is definitely a popular place - the patio was already full when we went around 10:30am, but plenty of seats inside. When we left an hour later, the place was already full. A great casual spot for some great seafood! The Carbon bar has an open and contemporary decor. There is a nice bar area along with a sizable dining area. The neighborhood is a bit on the sketch side, but it didn't bother me too much. Despite having a very diverse and thriving food scene, Indonesian restaurants are a very rare breed in Toronto. So I was extremely excited when I found out about Satay Sate, which brands itself as an Indonesian street food restaurant. Best of all, it is in my neighborhood of North York, just a very short walk away from North York TTC Station. A very cosy non-big chain coffee house. I love the decor here - it is modern yet comfortable. Kekou is really good and it's a shame Yelp doesn't do half-stars, because this place is more like 4.5 stars. Kiin is not your average Thai cuisine - it is wonderfully more upscale and the dishes are definitely much more high end than the typical Thai offerings elsewhere. This review is regarding drinks only at The Craft. As far as Asian restaurants go, there is absolutely no better place in Toronto to enjoy a lobster meal.  I was a little apprehensive about this place, given there are some negative reviews. But the fact that this place is packed on a Monday night speaks volumes. Aside from the expansive and cosy patio they have here, the interior of the restaurant is simply gorgeous - Giant tequila/liquor wall at the bar area, colorful decor, edgy wall art, rustic wood tables, to the Mexican wrestling mask in black lighting - all give a very fun and energetic vibe. It is very clear you will have a fun time here. Delysees has got to be the best French bakery/patisserie in Toronto Paldo Gangsan is easy to miss if you just walk along Bloor West and not aiming to go there. It is located up a flight of outdoor stairs, and it has a red store front sign.  I am IN LOVE with this place! I tried axe/knife-throwing and archery for the first time ever at Stryke, and I have to say I really enjoyed it! I hear that other places only usually have one activity and not the other, so I think Stryke offers a more comprehensive package of activities. There is also air gun shooting as well. Simply delicious pizza! This super popular small pizzeria serves Detroit-style pizzas with great toppings! The menu is on the small side but the pizza here is totally awesome. Ovest has a modern decor that is comfortable, with heavy usage of wood and earthy tones. It is a great place for groups or for intimate dates. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit out of the way for me...but good food is worth traveling for! A small casual eatery tucked away on the far east side of St Lawrence market area with great tasting fried chicken and waffles!  Although Lone Star is a chain, the food here is pretty decent and they have great crowd-pleaser type foods. They are more known for their Tex-Mex fijitas and do a great job at it. A good candy and desserts place in the heart of Unionville. Kinka izakaya offers an authentic Japanese experience, from the waiters and cooks who yell out orders (just like in Japan), to the taste of the food. What a gem of a place! First off, this place has awesome decor - a really authentic look with various Japanese posters that you would find in an Izakaya in Japan. I love the nice wood furnishings and table and lamps. Those who visit Martins will discover that this is a neighbourhood gem that they will come back to time after time.  Great new addition to the Esplanade! There are a variety of beers they brew on-location and I think this is a great place to grab a quick drink. This is the new downtown location for Royaltea, which is known for their lightbulb Bubble tea. I am surprised Ricarda's is not more popular. The decor here is modern and swanky. There is a nice bar area, a bakery section that bakes bread fresh every day and a very nice dining area. Small but very nice selection of good brews. The place is on the small side but it never gets too packed in here. \"[Foreword: My visit last week was mired with problems - the waiter was slow and took a long time for us to get drinks; they had a \"\"system issue\"\" and we had to repeat to the waiter to note the items we ordered for the bill. I am attributing these issues as \"\"waiter problems\"\" and not an issue with the establishment A decent sized gelateria. Passed by this little eatery and decided to give it a go. Have to say I really like it! It's a rather small space but they make good use of it. This is the smaller location of The Cups (bigger location is up North on Glen Cameron road) Il fornello is one of those neighborhood staple restaurants that are very reliable and have been around for a very long time, and eventually grown to have multiple locations. I remember eating at various Il Fornellos ever since I was old enough to afford a meal out. Over the years, I have stopped eating there, not because it is not good, but rather I was drawn to the many different types of restaurants that have shown up. I am definitely a fan of this place! Me and my group came here for Toronto's one and only Rijsttafel and I am happy to say everybody liked it. The Rickshaw bar is a small tapas style type of restaurant that serves food of pan-asian fusion style - but with a heavy Indian influence. The decor is dark, intimate, industrial yet chic. It has been a while since I have dined at Cluny, and I am very happy to say that the offerings here have improved with the recent arrival of their new executive chef Murray McDonald. I still clearly remember my first visit to Jinya a few years ago when it was new - I hated it. The menu laid out their ramen philosophy, and stressing the most important thing for ramen is the broth. Ironically the broth in the ramen I ordered was very oily and underwhelming in taste, and I stayed away ever since. Archeo is easy to miss when you are visiting the Distillery District and not specifically looking for it - even though it is right at the main gate entrance to the district, the exterior of this restaurant is so low key that it can easily be mistaken as a gift/clothing shop of some kind. If you do give them a try, you'll find that it is quite a solid restaurant with very reasonable prices given it's at a touristy location. T-swirl Crepe is a decent place to grab a quick dessert. This small creperie serves generously filled crepes and prices are on par with most dessert places. Miku is amazing in a lot of ways. You'd be forgiven to think miku is a snooty restaurant given the location and decor, but once inside and seated you'll find the wait staff quite friendly and accommodating. Kind of smacked right in the middle of nowhere in an industrial-like zone, but good brews can be found here. I love this little place! Tons of Asian groceries that you don't find in the typical loblaws/metro. It's not a huge place but they sure make good use of it. Spring Villa is a great place for dim sum, provided that you arrive early for their $2.99 special (for S, M and L dim sum) when you place your order before 11AM. Otherwise it might be on the pricey side for dim sum. This is a new location that just recently opened. I went on a Monday afternoon on a snowy day and it was pretty quiet. If you look past the rough-looking neighbourhood, the hole-in-the-wall feel of the restaurant and the plastic tables, you will be rewarded with a very yummy traditional Filipino Kamayan meal here at Tinuno - this is hands-down the best place in Toronto to do this. Alo was recently (Mar 1, 2017) named the top Canadian restaurant to dine at for 2017, but it was most definitely the top restaurant in 2016 as well for those in the know. Kingyo is a gem tucked away in cabbagetown. If you walk quickly you might miss it. Those who do visit however, will be rewarded with an authentic and fun Japanese izakaya. Sabai Sabai is excellent in every way. The decor is funky and hip, yet homey at the same time. Service was prompt and curteous. And most importantly, the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Situated in a hotel on the second floor, Lai Wah Heen isn't exactly a restaurant locals would stroll into for a meal. I visited Lai Wah Heen a few days ago for their Spring Equinox event where they collaborated with Sake Kurabu & That's Life Toronto for a set menu with Sake Pairing. Since this is a review for Lai Wah Heen, I will limit my review to the food, as sake is not what they usually offer. Big fan of this place! If you are a craft beer / microbrew beer lover, this place is a must do! This is one of the many kinton ramens located throughout the city. Able to find seats even during busy lunch hour. Good amount of parking spaces at the back and close to major intersection. Drinks are made promptly. Great Starbucks! I visited Antler for dinner and it was a fabulous meal! Great drinks and chill music. Visited on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet 8-9:30pm. The crowds starts flooding in after 10pm and they start charging cover to get in. I found the food at Pukka really modern and authentic, and have been there twice for foodie events. The restaurant has a very nice vibe to it, and the neighborhood seems to agree given that it is buzzing even on a Tuesday night with an ice storm outside. Ji is the sister restaurant to Pukka, which is just a few minutes walk away from each other. The only difference is the Ji is more of a pub that serves indian-inspired fare, than an actual indian restaurant. Don't let that get in the way of deterring you from a visit though, because the food at Ji is delicious. Good Starbucks with plenty of seats and quick service. I like the dark wood bookcases and comfy chairs. Big fan of this place! Nice decent sized patio and indoor seating, perfect for summer. I have to come back here a few more times just to be sure, but my first impression is good so far! You must try Buca Yorkville at least once, and when you do, it is imperative that you order the Burrata pizza. The pizza crust is nicely thin with good texture, and the combination of basil and burrata cheese gives the pizza a flavour that is refreshingly light, and elegantly so. MeNami is a fine place for a meal after work, if you work up at Yonge and finch area.  Sariwon is a decent Korean BBQ place, but it is important to know what you are aiming to eat there. If you are looking to get the best quality meats in Toronto, Cumbraes is hands-down the place to do it. They are the best butchers in town and there are several locations, but the queen west location is gorgeous. Does anyone dislike Cora's? Is that even possible? Though it is a chain, I find all Cora's that I have been to be very consistent. My favourite thing to get is Buckwheat Blessing, but I always order the cheese that comes with it to be put on the side - the portions are super generous! I especially enjoy the presentation of the fruits and I find having it quite enjoyable. Not all dishes have such a fruit accompaniment, so choose wisely! This is a very small pastry shop that specializes in Daifuku (stuffed mochi). They also sell macarons and doriyaki (a bun with red bean filling) and non-alcoholic beverages. Spacious, with drive thru available As a buffet place, I didn't really expect much of the food here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought all the items I tried were solid - it's prepared well, not overcooked and the flavour was decent. I especially like the mussels, which are green lipped New Zealand mussels that are known to be good quality and meaty.  \"I like Yutaka. Their menu consist a mixture of \"\"crowd pleasers\"\" (such as roll-type sushi) and some pretty authentic tasting Japanese dishes that are not as common.  This new little microbrewery actually hides some big tanks inside! Aboslutely love this Loblaws. It's huge and you can find pretty much find any food here. Love the big cheese fridge, alone with the various deli and cooked foods counters. The nutella cafe is a nice touch as well and can be a good place for a quick dessert. Great tasting thai food in the heart of the entertainment district downtown Toronto Yasu is definitely one of the top sushi experiences in Toronto, without being too harsh on the wallet Look no further if you want a quick yummy bite of one of the best bacon sandwiches Toronto has to offer. Some booth seating is available, along with a long counter. There is another location on queen east as well.  Little Sheep Hot Pot is alright if you have had prior Chinese hot pot experience. I find the pricing not too bad for an AYCE hot pot place. This is a new concept by the South Street Burger chain, and looks drastically different. It is more of pub than a fast food restaurant, and there is sit-down service. I really like the fact that they serve craft beer here, and also a full bar as well. Most notable is that they serve beer from Collective Arts Brewing, which is a big favourite of mine. Great ramen place and a very welcome addition to the Yonge/Finch area. Small resto right at Finch TTC station area. I was hesitant at first given that it doesnt look all that impressive on the outside, but inside the resto it is charming and has the typical Japanese resto look. Ramen Raijin has relocated to 24 Wellesley West, hidden in a small residential street at the back of the building of Rabba's convenience store. I came here on their opening weekend. When it comes to tonkotsu ramen, sansotei is definitely the best in town. The broth is rich, yet doesn't feel oily like other ramen places. The black garlic oil add-on is highly recommended and is my default goto every time I eat here This review is for the Sunday Brunch buffet, which doesn't come cheap and yet worth every penny if you are a seafood lover. Really like this place! Although they don't have a lot of gelato flavors, the flavors they have are great and there are always some funky flavors that are worth trying. Lasa by Lamesa is a casual cafeteria-like restaurant. You order at the counter, grab a seat, then wait for your name to be called to pick up your food. Lavelle is the place to be seen, especially in the summer when the outdoor pool area is open. Oretta is alright. We visited on a Tuesday night and it was decently busy. This review is for the Sunday Kamayan feast It is unusual for a local like myself to go on a tour in my own city, but I was given a chance to go on the Queen/King West Brunch tour from Culinary Adventure Company and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. Good David's tea - it's never that busy at this location so the staff here have more time to help if needed. Ding Tai Fung needs little introduction, I think everyone is familiar or have heard of their super awesome soup dumplings. I really like Amsterdam Brewhouse, even though for me it's quite a bit out of the way. There are decent beers on the tap, ad the food, even though not mind blowing, are good pub type dishes that goes well with beer. You know Adamson's BBQ is going to be great when you see a lineup on a cold day before they even open. The place is located in a somewhat odd neighborhood - a somewhat industrial area with warehouses, and contruction-type companies. It is also kind of out of the way, so you probably won't know it's there unless you know where to look beforehand. I can't believe I've waited this long to try this place - it's amazing! Located in the busy Distillery district, it is easy to walk by and miss Pure Spirits with their simple and understated facade, especially with the more eye-catching El Catrin, Cluny Bistro and Mill Street Brewpub. But if you give it a chance, you will find it to be a worthy restaurant to dine at. This is a new location for Moroco Chocolat (originally in Yorkville). It is a bit out of the way in a quiet-ish neighbourhood, but it is just a few minutes walk fron Dupont TTC station."
bcxcQhp0sKYd9eUnEVUzPA,"Having heard about the opening on Twitter, I nipped in on opening night to see what Clerk's Bar had to offer, and, like Alan S, was pleasantly surprised. Point the first: the shop is a working shop devoted to marshmallows and also stocking the finest in local artisan confectionery (Pinnies & Poppyseeds shortcake, Edward & Irwyn chocolate) - no longer any cafe element to it. Kitchen visible. Packaging stacked neatly on the shelves. Icing sugar tramped charmingly from till to window over the otherwise pristine shop floor. Nothing to do with little flutes - piccolo is Italian for small, which suits this Mondrian delight on the south-eastern corner of Grassmarket perfectly. Primary coloured benches surround three sides of a table in the window, unsinkably cheerful - rather like the proprietor (who, for the sake of clarity, does not surround three sides of a table by the window). I had a delicious panini - I can't remember precisely what was in it; bacon and some other things but they had me at bacon. It was perfectly done - fluffy yet crispy and generously filled, but not overly so. There's a good range on the menu, from droolworthy-sounding focaccias to a couple of really lovely soups. My partner for lunch that day had the vegetable soup and I'm told it was... brace yourselves... soup-erb. (Thank you, thank you...) My nearest shop - which takes me one minute and 42 seconds to get to from my door (yes, I timed it, I totally am that person) is Tesco Express. And, as I mentioned in my review, I have issues with Tesco Express in that it's 3p more for a Wispa than it is at a Tesco Metro or other competing supermarket of similar size. But I also have issues with laziness, and when it's the choice between walking for less than two minutes or for a whole FOUR to get to the Co-op, I'm afraid I often wimp out. \"The single most important thing to note is: punny pizza. Seriously, that's a menu and a half. \"\"Pepperoni Don't Preach\"\" - \"\"Tuna Turner\"\" - \"\"Frankie Goes to Holyrood\"\" (that one's got haggis)... on and on it goes! Yep, it's busy. It's so busy. As I slip in through the door, a young woman sliding out from behind a tiny table near the counter gives me a nod, conspiratorial, comforting. I smile in relief and prepare my bag for being quickly dumped as soon as she vacates. The world and its dog is here. Quite possibly the most beautiful street in all of Edinburgh, this elegant, curving, twin-layered goddess of a thoroughfare is perfectly placed to catch the light at the best time of the day. Its shops are a jamboree of colour and variety - book shop, pig shop, tweed shop, map shop, juice shop, dress shop, red, blue, pink, green. Up until recently it even featured a Christmas shop, and landed itself a starring role in the film adaptation of Filth. People, you - you do realise how awesome this street is, right? Right? I've heard people complain about the fact that there are shops only on one side. But - you guys! That's the whole point! That's the joy of it! What can I say? Hemma is where the heart is, and I think I left mine there! Two things led me to finally get my eyes checked out. The first, and one might reasonably assume most important, was certain episodes of blindness. The second, which was actually the trigger (don't judge me) was noticing a tendency to screw up my eyes very slightly when looking at my phone, and the realisation that, long term, this could give me WRINKLES. I'm now officially nearer to 30 than 20 so this is totally legit as a concern. Fling your hands up in dramatic horror - until yesterday I had never eaten something prepared or designed by Mr Greenaway! His reputation preceded him of course, and so when I came to Bistro Moderne to check out the Sunday roast with Sharon G, I had high expectations. I'm from a small rural Yorkshire village - I basically lived in an episode of Last of the Summer Wine for twelve years - so believe me when I say I KNOW tea shops. Chintzy, lacy, doily-laden tea shops. Shops where the clinking of translucent china cups and saucers rings like Christmas bells under the chatter of guests and the cold hiss of rain outside. Ooh but it's so DINKY! I've been meaning to try Wellington Coffee out for... oh, a while, so it was with great delight that I accepted an invitation to meet someone for coffee here one morning this week. Ooh, nice! You know somewhere's ok when they deliver your friend a drink with a clockwork monkey on a string. Chessboard floor, plenty of seating, nice downstairs by the looks of things and an efficient, if taciturn, water. \"They absolutely know what they're doing here. The whole place feels warm and wholesome, and the food seems pretty good for you too. In fact, I uploaded a pic to Yelp of one of the counters and intended to caption in \"\"counter of yumness\"\" but it autocorrected to \"\"counter of thinness\"\"... Realising the counter was laden with fruits and salads \"Commander Riker said, \"\"Blondes and jazz seldom go together.\"\" I'm not sure how fair that is to blondes \"WHAT?! I thought... I thought this place was tiny! I... I have to dress up as Thorin now and hug Robyn Z while saying emotionally: \"\"Never have I been so wrong.\"\" Memetastic. With a little imagination, some plywood walls and ramps in the dark can easily become an abandoned and dilapidated spaceship, where your mission is to destroy enemies on sight with your pew-pew laser gun. My brother (now legendary in my reviews, I feel) bought me a pair of second hand boots for Christmas 2012, and they are without question the best, most well-made, most comfortable and durable items of footwear I have ever had the pleasure of sliding my tootsies into. I wear them everywhere. This winter, when the stitching began to rot, I even painstakingly sewed them back up, myself. But re-heeling is beyond my ken. Twice. Twice in one weekend. Twice was I able to taste this majestic glory - the greatest rice pudding ever known on this little planet. Through the dark and cold of a winter's evening, amid the grim determination of throngs of Christmas shoppers, there shone a warm light from the market on Castle Street... the light of hope. The light of rice. Ohhhhh, that's it. That, my friends, is IT. I am updating. This place has to get the fifth star.I came here for lunch today with Nikki A and it garnered Major Bonus Points in a number of ways additional to those excellent features mentioned in my last review. I'm having a noodle love affair! Everyone I've brought here has fallen for Red-Box, just as I did, and comes back time and again. Even friends from out of town have clamoured for a trip to Red-Box at some point during their visit, and I'm pretty sure that's not simply to escape my notorious cooking. The variety of items on offer means that there's something for everyone, and you can either develop your own personal favourite or experiment with something new every trip, knowing it's going to be freshly cooked right from scratch there and then. No, but you don't understand, it isn't LIKE that, guys. It isn't snooty. It isn't scene. In fact, if you didn't know that everything here was good and virtuous, that whatever your dietary requirements you are probably guaranteed to find it catered for, you wouldn't realise that that was the whole point. Sure, there's gluten free stuff, vegan stuff, dairy free stuff, juice cleanses, organic boosters, aaaaaaall that jazz. *stands* My name is Cressida, and I am a stationery-aholic. \"The Queen's Hall is the venue that makes me proudest of Edinburgh. It's just so totally in love with live music - \"\"We *heart* it live\"\" is even written above the door - in a way that so many venues around the country don't seem to be Having just moved into an unfurnished flat, naturally my first stop for fitting it out with the necessary furniture on a tight budget was the Mystical Realm Of Flatpack. You know what you're getting with IKEA, and (assuming what you want is in stock) you get the same at every branch. So what's so good about this particular branch? \"When Moray L and I fancied one of our dinner and catchup evenings near to her work, Field sprang to mind as a place I'd been meaning to try for ages. And with a dinner earlybird \"\"pre-theatre\"\" for £14.95 it was hard to find a reason not to! This ought to be a five-star review. It's slap bang on the Royal Mile, so this must be one of the busiest Starbucks branches in the world in August, but somehow they keep on serving efficiently and effectively. It's normally pretty busy in the morning too - coffee rush hour, unsurprisingly - but their morning supervisor is a delight. He welcomes every single new queue member through the door with a smile, takes names and orders on arrival and lines up the neatly labelled cups for the baristas to fill assiduously in sequence. There have been times when I've felt like I really must be the highlight of his day, only to see him greet those who arrive behind me with equal geniality. That's service with a smile, folks. I'm not an outdoorsy type by any stretch of the imagination (and my imagination is particularly stretchy) so it's rare for me to find myself in a place like this, but I followed my friend in as she hunted for a new waterproof for her climbing exploits. Ok, so, as promised, here is an update... and it's still four stars. To beard - verb: to boldly confront or challenge. But while it's bold, there's nothing confrontational about this new barber-themed bar. It's cosy but not poky, light but not glaring, and there's so much space that will easily fit the many people who no doubt will begin to flock here as word spreads. I was confused. I couldn't work out where the museum was. It must have been there somewhere. Light, spacious and glass-fronted, with stand-alone bookshelves, tallboy tables, free Wifi and sofas in the corner, Loudons was perhaps a little too comfortable for a museum cafe, but surely the lost treasures of ancient Babylon were in another building just around the corner somewhere, for what else would cause a beautiful place such as this to charge an eye-watering £6.45 for a pot of rooibos tea and a slice of cheesecake? Cheesecake, I might add, which I had to plate up for myself. Funky is the first word to come to mind. The place is all pinks and purples and turquoises and dark tables. Even the water jugs are purple or turquoise. There's a plasma screen showing a loop commercial for their King of Curry thing that they do, with their top media hits included. It's kind if distracting watching Jack Whitehall and James Corden crying and drinking bowls of yoghurt, but it kind of fits with the funky thing. If they took out the tables, chucked in a couple of lava lamps and cushions, and maybe tiled one wall with tiny mosaic mirrors, it'd be a cocktail bar nightclub. This is a definite treat restaurant for me. Bigger prices, smaller portions, but I find that when food is this good you don't need as much to fill you up - every mouthful counts double. I have a dark and terrible secret. An overpowering addiction... To ribbons. Fat ones, thin ones, lacy ones, satin ones, plain ones, trimmed ones, patterned ones... I just love ribbons. And when I discovered this shop... Well, I can tell you I went a little off the rails for a while... FYUL is, first and foremost, a pretty risky name. Standing for Food You Utterly Love, it's a challenge, hurling down the gauntlet with a wink. Go on, it says. Try us. Apparently, Sabor Criollo has been here for like six centuries or something (possible exaggeration) so I don't even know how I hadn't heard of it before. Were I wearing a hat, though, I would be tipping it most genially in Blythe R's direction for bringing our monthly dinner club to this adorable little beach shack in a Stockbridge basement. Ok, ok, ok. Hang on a sec. Say WHAT? Three courses for £7.50? Did you say that right? Right, ok, so we're talking morsels and crumbs... plates the size of teaspoons... right? I'm super-finicky about orange juice, but this morning as I bimbled aimlessly along the street, I had a bizarre and sudden craving for a big glass of the stuff. Boy, was I lucky to be on Nicolson Street when the craving descended: I definitely hit the right joint. \"The Yelp five star description is \"\"As good as it gets\"\". And sure This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. The Golden Bite has ruined fish and chips for me forever. Because I will never - EVER - find a fish supper superior, or perhaps even equal, to the one I had this weekend from the Golden Bite. Oh boy. This is what I've been waiting for. Welcome, bold adventurer, to Falko Konditormeister, den of marvels. It all began with a goat. Bravo, Whisky Shop! I have been timid about entering you, for I know about as much as a wicker platypus does about whisky. I don't drink, you see, and even when I did, whisky wasn't my tipple. I had to be there in two hours. My dress, a sturdy and somewhat matronly double-breasted affair in tough, heavy stretch cotton, had arrived in the post that morning, and bore all the signs of having been posted. My flat, still not fully furnished, contained no iron and my attempts to tame the creases with hair straighteners were limping sadly to a halt. Oh no. Oh no oh no. This was to be a big night for me - how could I show up all crinkly? I seem to remember an old advert in which a Lancastrian family was having an argument and their entire vocabulary was the word Potato. \"The menus are battered and the new waiter, bless him, had to peer at where I was pointing on the menu to work out what I was asking for when I said \"\"umeboshi\"\" (although maybe that's my quiet voice and poor pronunciation at work) but my Oh, THIS is how you do it. This. Right here. Classic Nouveau design in the auditorium meets chic ultra-modern comfort in the foyer.  The huge glass-fronted foyer goes up three storeys, and never feels crowded even in the pre-show buzz. I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Festival Theatre before given how many times I've come here and loved it. They do everything right. Ok, so the first thing you need to know is that the light fittings in here are little ice creams. I ain't kidding. They're adorable. It's mouse-wee and, with bare wood everywhere and a Wes Anderson coffee-table book there for the browsing, well, you could say it was hipster as hell. But who cares? Is that actually a perjorative term anyway? They are a coffee shop, and so they have coffee, good coffee, although despite my recent CoffeeEpiphany™, I am very glad that I chose the hot chocolate, because... kids, let me tell you about that hot chocolate. My bedroom when I was a young teen was blue and orange - walls, ceiling and carpet all deep royal blue; all furniture, skirting boards and door and window frames were the brightest bright orange. So in a way, walking into the orangey warmth of Rodi and enjoying its shots of deep blue felt a little bit like coming home. I want a taxi that shows up in minutes, comes with a friendly driver, doesn't charge the earth, and is easy to book. Oh, sure, sure, it's not without its flaws. It's changed hands and they're not consistent on the service (I was sitting there for about ten minutes before someone toddled over my way, but to fair, I had my laptop open so I didn't really look like I was waiting). Also, I have learned the hard way that their wifi just ain't friendly. Luckily, I can hotspot from my phone with no problems, but others aren't so fortunate, I'm sure. \"Historically, of course, the region of Dalriada was situated on the west coast of Scotland. However, it seems to have landed very comfortably after its migration across the country; now situated entirely within a magnificent turreted seafront house on the eastern coast at Portobello, it could have done a lot worse.

It looks like my fingers are too fat now to type. I am instead typing this laboriously using a paintbrush held between my teeth. I also fill my entire sofa, and hang over the sides. But if you seize the folds of my face and lift them to seek out the features underneath, you will see something that looks like a radiant beatific smile. Friends, I tried Burger. Tea at 94 was the first place to become a favourite spot for me when I moved to Edinburgh, and not just because I lived practically opposite. \"I came here on rugby day and thought it would be packed out, but in fact there was room to move and the bar staff were being pretty speedy with service (except for me, but I wasn't giving off \"\"I'm waiting signals\"\" Once upon a time, not so very long ago, this was Trattoria Italiana, and it was Really Not Good. It closed shortly after I started Yelping, so it was spared the ignominy of my words. It's incredible that it took me so long to try this place out because it is literally my nearest location. Nearer even than Tesco. Basically, whoever lives in the flat above the FTCS and I could pretty much play charades from our windows if we wanted to. \"So... I have this thing about roses. If there are roses anywhere on it, or mentioned, or otherwise involved, I'm pretty much a dead cert to like it. But I confess I had some vague preconceptions of this place from the reviews I'd read and I expected something a little twee, a bit \"\"quirky\"\" in that slightly forced sense. So when I came here for the Yelp brunch I was surprised to find that from the outside it looks pretty much like any other relatively nice pub. It's really nice here - comfortable booths and seats, and lots of space. It feels kind of diner-ish, but with a hint of cocktail bar vibe too. Their gin and tonic menu is wonderful - following our tutorial at One Square I now know how important the right tonic is and they explain on the blackboard which tonic will be served with which gin (including the Caorunn and Fentiman's pairing offered at One Square). Much better than just dumping a Schweppes into everything! The heady scent of incense filled the air in Bindi as the Yelpers gathered for their vegetarian Indian Thanksgiving. The chairs were squashy and high-backed, arranged around a quirky T-shaped table arrangement. Among those of us seated next to the large and beautifully-decorated plate glass window, there was a little shuffling and struggling to slip in and out, but the passing of plates and dishes to those least accessible made for a fun party game and added to the celebratory atmosphere of our gathering. Tanya L had brought hand turkeys, and Julie G, in addition to Gobbles the turkey Beanie Baby, who served as our table mascot, had brought two big boxes with her containing pumpkin pie. The staff, far from being offended that we'd brought our own dessert, were more than happy to take them into the kitchen until they were needed, and even brought out a specially-made pumpkin curry to add to our dinner! How do I love thee, Brew Lab? Let me count the ways. I'm told you're super coffee heroes, to those that are qualified to discuss such matters. Well, here's a star for being great at everything non-coffee AS WELL. Yes, your hot chocolates are divine. Your tea selection includes my new favourite, lavender rooibos. OooOoOoOOOOoooo. Bangers and mash make me a happy lady. My tum is thanking me even now, eight hours later. It was a Sunday. My brother was visiting. What else do you do with family on a Sunday... it was time for Sunday Roast! The Fountain having some good roast reviews here on Yelp, we decided to check it out. Muted sage-teal walls make a fresh but homely atmosphere and we were greeted immediately with swift and bright service. We hadn't booked ahead but we had a drink at the stylish yet cosy bar while a table came free (which was surprisingly quick - less than ten minutes - but we were there at six-ish so quite early). Sis! Happy birthday!\" \"Yellow Bench has a Yellow Bench outside. It does when it's open. For this reason, I marched straight past it when it wasn't quite open yet and realised too late that I had gone too far, and so from being slightly early to meet Sara C I went to being slightly late. But no matter. The bench was there when I returned and bears the charming legend \"\"BY SITTING ON THIS BENCH I AM OPEN TO CONVERSATION WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER\"\". (There's one of these outside Zupa too). One weekend when I have a free moment I intend to go and sit on that bench. When you're dealing with a party of 20 or so, finding the time to tweet them a photo of the beautifully-set Christmas tables all ready and waiting, WELL before they arrive, is probably a sign that you have got things well under control. And when you manage to bring out all of the dishes for each course in fairly impressive synchrony, well, that's confirmation. I have always suffered from bus anxiety. How do I know which number to get? Which is my stop? How do I plan a route? What will the fare be? Due, no doubt, to its being the largest working theatre in the whole of the UK, the Playhouse always has an impressive programme. There are a lot of seats to fill, and there are plenty of other venues in Edinburgh playing to the more adventurous, so there's nothing to criticise about the fact that the Playhouse caters to a popular audience. Large-scale touring musicals (usually from London's West End) are the main bill of fare, with big-name musicians and successful TV comedians forming the bulk of the rest. \"I had walked past here many times; this weekend was my first venture inside. Maybe it's the dull hue of the paint used on the sign outside, but I was thoroughly taken aback by its pleasant and light interior. Not what I was expecting at all. It's quite kooky, as well, with a clock decorated with brightly-coloured cutlery, and a lovely piece of art on the wall that reminded me of something Dr Seuss might have created if given the brief \"\"stringy lake of afternoon tea\"\". HOLD IT. HOLD IT. As some of you know, I am on an ongoing mission to find the greatest Eggs Benedict in all of Egginburgh. For many months, Kilimanjaro Coffee has held the crown. No longer. No longer. I will never understand how it took me so long to get around to coming here. And if I'm not back within two weeks then I shall eat my hat. Sandy Bell's is best known for its nightly session; a lot of sessions can descend into chaos with a surfeit of guitars and squeezeboxes, but on the night we went everything was very nicely balanced. The bouzouki and flautist were especially good and they had a solid bunch of tunes (not just Irish ones) in their noggins. Come for the saving, stay for the quality. By not providing non-essential things like hairdryers (but there are power sockets if you want to bring one), towels (again, bring your own) or Wifi (seriously, who needs that in a gym?!) this gym can pass on the saving, meaning they can offer a rolling month-by-month membership for just £16 (and I think there's a wee joining fee of about £20). Compared to a huge number of gyms in the city, that's almost obscenely low. Pennies! Plus, if you know you're not going to make it there for a month, which is especially applicable in Edinburgh (cough August cough) then you can suspend your membership and skip all but £5 of that month's payment. Niiiice. How lucky, how fortunate we are to live in a city like Edinburgh, and how much more so that it contains something as flawlessly beautiful as Grassmarket. This teensy little Post Office does a roaring trade due to its super-central location, so don't be surprised if you have to line up outside. It doesn't provide passport forms and the like, so for your official document needs you will have to head elsewhere, but if all you want is a jiffy bag and to post a packet, this'll do you nicely. The staff are pretty perky too, which is jolly nice when you finally reach the front of the line. Tucked away on a corner of East Claremont Street sits this cute little oddity. Peopled with cheery staff, furnished with smooth conker-red leather benches and containing a shelf laden with teetering piles of board games, Elbow is the kind of place I'd like to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon after a long walk. There's even an old 2-player arcade game set into a coffee table and surrounded by beanbags. Hooray! They say that the best thing about Appleton Tower is that when you're inside it, you can't see it. Well, it's true, you can't. But that's far from the best thing, and not at all the main reason that I actually LIKE going there. \"She and I, we have a strange friendship. She invites me into her home on occasion - she never comes to mine. Each time, I am quietened. For example, I will pick up a cushion, and she will casually mention its value. I'll quickly replace it, blushing. \"\"Sorry Delicate chairs in candyfloss hues, tiny model birds in ornate cages, inviting and rotund jars of sweets on the windowsill, and the cakes, oh the cakes, lining the counter with a riot of colour and a promise of delight... This is my kind of place. Sweet things. From the moment I walked through the entrance, I was... Entranced. Punny but true. Larger than I expected, and darker, more romantic, was this beehive around which there had been such buzz. There was beautiful, unusual art on the far wall, and fairy lights twisted around the mantel above the warm electric fire. Behind me, a vast blackboard proclaimed the day's specials in proud lettering, and the staff bid me a friendly hello as I pranced past, a spring already in my step. Yes, friends, sometimes I go to Starbucks in search of wifi. I feel much better about sitting for hours on end with one £2 cup of tea on Starbucks' dime than anyone else's - I would get the guilt if I did it to anybody else! I was unprepared for this. UNPREPARED. Beautiful lasagne, colourful and flavoury salads (shut up, flavoury is totally a word) and a chap playing such soul drenchingly gorgeous jazz piano that I had to stop eating on three separate occasions because it took away my ability to do anything but sit and attempt to breathe. I came here today for lunch with Tanya L, at her recommendation, and first I have to say - thanks, Tanya! What a lovely place! As you all know, I'm a big fan of the Festival Theatre both as an arts venue and just as a building in general, so I was already pretty sure I'd like the light and space that I could see from outside was a feature of Th'eatery, and I do love a good punny name. Come on. Seriously. This is crazy. EVERYTHING here is fabulous. The dizzyingly high ceilings, the splendid sense of opulence without ostentation, the chirpy serving staff, the hot ch... hot ch... hot... cho... sorry, I went off into a little dreamland for a moment there. What was I saying? Oh, yes, the hot chocolate! Thick, rich, dark hot chocolate to slide into your tummy on a cold winter's day... Mmmm... What a tremendously civilised little spot this is! Elegant and sweet, with lovely teal and fuchsia chairs, it's a charming place to get your tea fix. \"Fondue?! Count me in!\"\" That was the message that shot back immediately when I texted my friend mentioning Juniper's Fondue Fridays. I'd heard great things about the cocktails at this new pad but that wasn't a massive pull for me. But fondue - well Ahh, Cockburn Street, my picturesquely twisting friend, what delights you hold! When Blythe told me he'd checked out a new spot that he thought that I, in particular, would really like, I got quite excited and resolved to toddle along as soon as I could. We were sitting right next to the entrance, and the howling page boys of Storm Emily were rolling out a red carpet of dead leaves ahead of her arrival, pushing as many through the revolving door as they possibly could. Perhaps it was the Bloody Vintages and espresso liqueurs, perhaps it was Christmas cheer, or perhaps it was just that the place is generally pretty cosy, but somehow the Yelpers brunching within remained warm and snug despite the elements. It seems mad to say that shops that are run entirely on customer donations often have individual styles, but it's true. The charity shop family is well-defined in my mind. There's the older lady in lemon crimplene with porcelain horses on her mantelpiece. There's her nephew in denim and his wife in a floral shift dress. There are the cool students in jackets, jeans and boots, listening to vinyls. What do you want from a sandwich shop? Well, if you can start with a love of sandwiches, it's a good sign. Caffe Espresso - Bingo. This one goes out to my former colleagues at the Fringe Society! I flitted my way to the Dragonfly for the Cocktail Quest UYE this week, and was surprised to find, once inside, that there weren't many dragonflies to be seen anywhere in the décor. I'd been expecting flashes of blue and green, delicate lacy wings... maybe I was being too literal: it's certainly colourful and exotic, with a richly patterned mix of wallpapers. There was also a definite *buzz* about the inaugural night of the Quest, so that's enough dwelling on insect references! (Tigers actually seemed to be the order of the day - I befriended a porcelain tiger who looked rather cross, but perhaps he had just had one too many.) \"My brother flung the door open with a flourish and strode in. \"\"I'M TAKING YOU OUT FOR TURKISH Would it be too obvious to say that Looking Glass Books is... a wonderland? I think this is my spiritual home. It's got everything I need. Chess tables. (I have pieces, but no board). Shiny floor. Books. Macarons. Wi-Fi. WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE. The only negative part of coming here was feeling myself shrivel into a raisin of regret at not having come before."
tBANVdxh_if10BXv6YsLmg,"You know, I probably spent an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with a joke about the name of this place that would reference a pleasure center in a bowl of soup... but so far I'm coming up with nothing. Oh well, I'll just write a review about how good this place is, and leave the jokes to the writers of 30 Rock. My girlfriend had a silver ring which broke, with a large piece of lapis lazuli inset. I found Barnes via Yelp and decided to pop over for a visit to see what they could do with it. They took the ring and said that they'd try to get the stone out, and after that could create a new ring for it from gold, white gold, or platinum. I asked about silver, and they said that they didn't work with it but could refer me to someone who does. So I left the ring with them, and the next day they called me to let me know it was ready. I went by and they'd sucessfully managed to remove the stone. I pulled out my credit card, but there was no charge. I was really impressed with their customer service- if you're in the market for some high-end jewellry this is *DEFINITELY* the place for you. This place was fan-TAS-tic!!!! Yup. I stand by my convictions. Tried a new pizza from here, and some boneless chicken tenders. As far as the chicken tenders- they were lightly breaded and just tangy enough. And the pizza was, as I've come to expect, absolutely amazing. Their deliveries are always prompt, and their prices are reasonable as well. Wait- I thought that I'd already reviewed them? Maybe not, but anyways... Damned tasty food, with only a few little complaints. I really, really like this place, but I'm a little sore at the right now. Not sore enough to really dock a star, but sore nonetheless.  After a few more great date nights, this place could easily get that extra star. Solid, delicious pho. If I lived closer, I'd probably eat here a LOT, but it's a little outside of my area so I might not make it back for awhile. Wasn't able to familiarize myself with the menu overmuch, but they seemed to present a solid menu of offerings. I'd like to be able to write more about it, but all I can say is that I had a great experience with a solid bowl and Vietnamese coffee. Service was prompt and attentive... so there ya go! Had a great experience here. I was immediately greeted as soon as I pulled up to the store by the friendly staff, and talking to their service department was a breeze. I told them what was wrong, they said that they'd check it out, and that was that. Diagnosed, fixed, charged a reasonable rate, and after a short wait I was on my way. Everyone was very polite and professional! Stopped by here today to see where they're located and what they've got. It's a very small little place, and would be quite easy to miss. On their website they give really good directions, and you have to remember to watch for the Laundromat next door. So, after several years, we decided to stop back in here for breakfast. I really like this place. I'd been to their locations in Denver before they opened here in Gilbert, and I was a fan of them there. Unabashedly hipsteresque, but that shouldn't stop you from stopping by. Their food is damned good, and even when they're a little busy they have plenty of seating to accommodate crowds. Their portions are a little on the smaller side but that wasn't a problem for me- my meal was large enough to eat in one sitting and not feel horrible, but not really large enough to eat half of and take the rest home.  Alright, it's time to update my review for this place. And I'm very happy to be able to give them five stars, because honestly they've far surpassed my hopes and expectations.  Came here for dinner one night with my girlfriend and the ladies, and I was an extremely happy man. I wasn't expecting much- Mexican food in my area is pretty whitewashed, but this was actually the real deal. It's fancier than your average taco stand, and their fare is a bit more upscale than street food, but the fact that they actually pay attention to what they're doing REALLY shows. This place has some solid offerings. We ate on the sushi bar side, and I was quite pleased by what we had. Nothing exceptional, but everything was great. A solid four-star experience (and they even have a few special Hawaiian beers!). I'll definitely come back, for no better reason than it's close to where I live. But I'm pretty sure that I'll never be disappointed, and will always be pleased. This review is nominally about the specific Fry's location, but it's more importantly about my main man Clifford, who is a giant among men. Stopped by here again to get a ring resized- from the moment that I walked in I was greeted with a big smile and a friendly welcome. They remembered me from the last time I had come by, so that was a really nice touch. Once again, they were very kind, and being in the store felt almost as if I were standing in their living room looking at jewelry. Alright Guailo, calm down a bit with all the reviews about this place being the Almighty Second Coming. Y'all need to just take a moment and breathe. Stopped in here for lunch- we weren't sure if they were open or not, and I'm not exactly sure that they WERE open, but they said that they'd make us a sampler platter for lunch. The buffet wasn't set up, and they didn't have a separate lunch menu, so we just had a nice little sampler platter. I'm knocking one star because of their lunch setup. I came here today and I really wasn't impressed. They have a small menu, but that's fine. There's still plenty of good offerings to be had. The place is hectic as always, and that's nothing new. Service isn't amazing, but you really shouldn't expect for it to be. These people are *REALLY* Chinese, and I'm sorry to say that most Asian restauranteurs don't conform to the American standards of courtesy. It's a different culture, and it is what it is- deal with it. You'll probably have to wave a server down if you want something, because they won't be doting on you every five minutes. This is usually born from the fact that they have a HELL of a lot going on all at once, so don't take it personal, guailo. I have trust issues with dentists. My previous dentist lost my good faith for reasons that I don't care to get into here, but let's just say that he was a bit on the 'aggressive' side of the spectrum. This is my go-to delivery spot for pizza and wings, and with good reason.  This place is a jewel in the rough, and I think that a lot of people won't have the pleasure of discovering how good their food actually is. That's too bad, because this place has got some tasty treats waiting for you. I've stopped in here a few times within the past few weeks in order to pick up some meats. Notably, their filet mignons are probably the best that I've ever had. I've been experimenting with sous-vide cooking lately, and those thick filets really take well to it. A nice sear on each side, and you've got yourself one hell of a date night!  YUP. \"You know what, fancy-pants? When is the last time that you came to Panda Express, ate, and left saying to yourself \"\"Oh my god that is NOT what I was expecting Came here yesterday with my lady and we really, *REALLY* enjoyed our dining experience! We ordered the steak skewers, classic ramen with spicy broth, pork belly bao, and Thai tea. Everything was really, really good! The steak skewers were tender and juicy, and the sauce which came with them was wonderful. The ramen was really good- definitely not a substitute for a place which specializes in ramen, but good nonetheless. One extremely nice touch was that the egg was perfectly soft-boiled, which is a rarity at most places. The pieces of pork belly in the ramen were really delicious- perfectly crisped yet tender and flavorful. The bao, though, were a five-star food. Perfect little sandwiches, they've become our new craving in the casa. Face it- Jiffy Lube is great. For a business which pretty much has the industry cornered, they go a great job at what they do. Everyone drives, and cars need oil changes. Taking it to a dealership or garage almost *ALWAYS* requires an appointment, and is usually pretty expensive. Jiffy Lube does what needs to be done in an efficient, reasonably-priced manner. You pull up, they take your car, you take a nap inside, and $40 later you have peace of mind for another 5k miles. Goodness gracious this place has some amazing burgers. far we've been here twice, and both experiences were top-notch. Everything that they make here is outstanding, and honestly these have been some of the most decadently delicious burgers which I've eaten in Arizona. They do the classics well, but they also have a few adventurous items (nothing crazy- I didn't see any foie gras burgers, although I would TOTALLY eat that and please someone make this happen for me right now). Their onion rings are the Gods' truth, and their fancy soda dispenser had some very cool options. Who doesn't want an icy Mello-yello with lunch?!?!? Shaanxi cuisine, huh? I'd never really heard of it before, but thanks to a recommendation from a helpful Yelper, I've now had the pleasure of dining at House of Egg Roll. This place is a gem, because you can find things here that you just *CAN'T* find elsewhere. Now, that being said... there's a LOT of stuff here that you CAN find elsewhere, and I'd encourage you to do so. This isn't your one-stop-shop. Go to Fry's first, and get everything you need. But if you're preparing a special recipe and want to find something with an extra 'oomph', then you owe it to yourself to stop by here. Their USDA Prime meats are *AMAZING*. I'm not kidding. If you're a regular meat eater then you OWE it to yourself to treat yourself to the Prime meats at some point (for Choice and lower, you can get good cuts at other places).  This little place is fantastic! Their donut selection is amazing, and the service is always great. The maple bacon donut was my favorite until I tried the old fashioned, which became my favorite until I tried the bearclaw, which was my favorite until I tried the tiger's tail, which was my favorite until... are you starting to get the picture here? Go in, grab yourself a dozen, and feel good about a)  supporting a new, local business, and b)  DOOONUUUUUUTS!!!! The girl who runs the shop is always really nice- my girlfriend and I have been in here a few times and we've always really enjoyed our experience. Eh, I'm really on the fence about this place. It is what it is- this is where the bodybuilders come. These people are *SERIOUS* about their fitness, and it shows. You come here a few nights a week, and you'll see the SAME PEOPLE HERE night after night after night. It can be a little intimidating, and honestly if it wasn't for the fact that my personal trainer works here I would have stayed at my other gym. But it's fine- the biggest complaint that I have is the fact that it's always PACKED. You're going to have to park a ways away at most hours, and there's always a HORDE of people working out here. In all honesty though, I've only rarely ever had to wait for any machines. And anytime I did have to, I was able to just jump in between sets with whoever was on it.  Ya know what?? DON'T HATE.  As soon as I moved to the Valley I started scoping out the liquor stores in the area. You've got your BevMo's, Total Wine, and a few nice little neighborhood package stores; but this store... THIS store... Oh I'm most definitely a fan. The food is top-notch here, but there are just a few things that make this a little short of five-star in my book.  Had a great experience with Frank- he helped me find a rental house in the Chandler/Gilbert area. I had flown into town for a few days to look at some apartments and home rentals, and I saw Frank's name on a few listings, so I emailed him in order to get in touch and see if he had any leads on houses. Within the hour he had put together a custom 'portal' for me to peruse houses and browse through the listings. I was able to pick which ones I liked, and not long after that he had already started setting up appointments for the next day. We've been here twice now, and I'm greatly impressed. Really impressed. More impressed than I would have imagined that I'd be. I usually come here at least once a month to meet with friends, and it's always a great experience. The only problem that I have with it is that there really isn't a large selection of pastries or other 'treats' to go with the coffee. That being said, the coffee is good enough to stand on it's own. And their mochas are works of art. The service is always great, and they never have a problem with my group taking over a large part of the cafe. If you're in the neighborhood and you need a place to come hang, enjoy coffee, read a book or whatever, then this is the place for you! This place is fantastic. Seriously.  Alright, I think I've figured this place out now... I hate you, Yelp algorithm. I know that I've written a review for this place before. I know that I have. But Yelp randomly deletes reviews, or something like that. Anyways... Do you watch that show 'Portlandia'? If so, then you're already familiar with this place. Not because the restaurant itself is featured in the show (it's not), but because this restaurant is the sort of place that they're always poking tongue-in-cheek fun of. It's hipsterish, it's a wee bit self-important, and you'll come up on phrases like 'hand-crafted' a LOT, but the simple fact of the matter is that they've got DAMNED good food, some DAMNED good coffee, a DAMNED friendly staff, and DAMNED adequate seating. I have to give another five-star to this place because of their customer service. Several times now I've come here a little after 8:30, and they've always been perfectly happy to whip up some last-minute meals for takeout. I know I have horrible timing, but never once have they turned me away for showing up a little bit before they close. Service like that is appreciated. :) Pho is a tricky dish. It's hard to get it really 'wrong', and very easy to skate by with a mediocre product. By the time you're face-down in a bowl, you're usually too hungry to really care if it isn't top-notch. We stopped by today for a couple of bowls, and were really pleasantly surprised. When we walked in, the first thing that we noticed was the smell. This place smells *RIGHT*. It smells like vats of broth that have been cooking for ages. Pho seeps through the walls here, and it's obvious that they've got some good stuff cooking away.  Yeah... I've gotten several deliveries from the good people at Social Box, and I have to say... for me, this is as good as it gets. Everything that I've gotten from them has been top-notch, and their delivery has always been accurate and timely. You know what? I love this place. I love this place because I've been getting delivery from them for about a year now almost every week. Their good has it all- a good amount of variety, a great amount of taste, speedy service and reliable consistency with getting my orders right. They've got all of your Thai favourites, but they also break the mould by offering some specialities that you probably won't find elsewhere. Today I tried their catfish for the first time and it is AMAZING! A new favorite of mine. Yeah, I dug this place. It looks like they've been here for awhile, and the quality of the food leads one to believe that they'll be here for awhile longer. Wait- how have I not reviewed this place yet??? \"If you haven't been here in awhile, for whatever reason, then you owe it to yourself to come back!!! They've done a great job making a few simple changes, and you owe it to yourself to come check 'em out again. The signs are now much more user-friendly and the products are all clearly-labelled and well-organized. The biggest change has been the addition of the organic section- it's HUGE and there are things in it that you just won't find anywhere else. Not only do they have a large organic selection, it's a large *international* organic selection. Check it out- you'll definitely find a lot of cool stuff that will have you saying \"\"Oh wow Grubhub, God bless you for bringing Bella Gusto into my life. First off, you need to know that the men's bathroom is haunted. I'm not kidding. I sat outside for probably 15 minutes waiting for whoever was inside to come out, then finally I asked the manager if he had a key. Maybe no one was even in there? So the manager unlocked the door and looked inside- there was no one in there. So maybe someone had accidentally locked the door before closing it? Nope- the door locks with a deadbolt, so only someone from inside can lock it. Maybe it was locked from the morning before? Nope, that exact manager said that he had opened it earlier in the day. So yeah... there's a capricious entity haunting that bathroom.  I've had delivery no less than twenty times from these good people, and I can't stop raving about it. Some items from their menu (ants climbing a tree, szechuan style wings, and ANY pork dish) have become staples of my diet, and I honestly can't find simple joy in life without them. If I could figure out a way to liquefy them and take it straight to the vein, then I probably would. Their service has always been exceptional, and even when you call up an order, if the person taking your order can't understand you (or vice versa) they'll find someone at the restaurant who can. Seriously- it's happened several times when I've phoned in orders.  This place is really, really neat. It's a great place to bring the family and let the kids run around. The landscaping around the restaurant is fun to check out, and it's great for a post-meal stroll to work off some of that great food. Do this: So this has become my go-to on Grubhub for deliery. It's not the end-all-be-all of Chinese delivery, but it's quite good and consistently enjoyable. I've been wanting to stop by here for a good long while now, and I can honestly say that last night was worth the wait. We came here for a later dinner, and were amazed at how much business they were doing. After a prompt greeting, we were seated, and our enthusiastic server (I think his name was CJ?) talked us through the menu. We ordered some sodas, looked over the menu, and decided on dinner. I wanted to get the Dungeness crab, but they were out, so I opted for the King crab. My girlfriend ordered the fried cod, and we decided to split an order of the grilled oysters that were on special.  I'm really excited for this place. They're really close to my house, and they have really good sushi. Looks like they get some good specials in every once in awhile, as well. I came in for lunch one day and had a very tasty meal. They had anago on the specials board, but they were already out of it by the time I came in. Ah well- next time! I can't sleep on these folks! I stopped in here for lunch today... interesting story... Soup Dumplings. Let me just open with that. This place is scratching an itch that I didn't even know I had!\" They've got a little bit of everything here. From all over the world, you'll find stuff here that will difficult, if not IMPOSSIBLE, to find at most other places. They specialize in Asian goods, but you'll find treats from the Carribean and Latin America as well. Their produce is STELLAR, and even their selection of ALCOHOL is amazing. Four stars, but an easy five with another good experience. This place is a great alternative to the options at Sky Harbor. Yeah, the food is pricey. Yeah, it's heavy on the belly. Yeah, it takes awhile for your order to be ready. But in the end, it's worth it. I've had their sandwiches several times, and they're always top-notch. The pork belly is a bit heavy, but if you have someone to split it with then it's just about perfect. And their fries will knock yours socks off... but chances are you have a spare pair in your luggage, so that shouldn't be a problem.  This place really ain't bad. Matter of fact, it's quite good. The tacos are a little on the small side, but they're definitely two solidly delicious bites. I wish that there was a bit more variety (buche, chicharron, or tripa) but they DO have lengua and cabeza, and they do what they do really well. Looks like they also have daily menudo, so I'ma have to see 'bout dat. This is the place that I've dreamt of for oh-so long. After the closing of my beloved Jade House, I wondered how any restaurant could ever fill the hole in my heart. Ladies and gentlemen, I am SO glad to announce... that restaurant has come. I got in, I got out. Reasonably priced, friendly service. This location is also pretty conveniently located so that you can walk over to Panda Express while you wait and get your Chinese on, if that's your thang. Ordered some wings and a Meatza pizza tonight. An hour and a half later, I still hadn't received my order, so I called the restaurant. After a few minutes, I ended up speaking with the manager, who was extremely apologetic and told me that they'd immediately make and delivery the order, and throw in a free two-liter of soda. I couldn't stay mad at them- the manager was genuinely apologetic and really wanted to make the situation right. Well, I said that I'd return and give this place another shot, so I did. Coming to this Wal-Mart is always a wonderful experience. This place was damned fine. A small little joint that's been here for eons, they serve up tasty fried seafood and extremely tasty burgers. We stopped by here for an unhealthy lunch and we were extremely happy with everything- their fish and shrimp are fried to perfection, and their burgers have that 50's-style that nothing else can scratch the itch for. All in all, this is a great place to swing by and have a tasty bite to eat!! The drivers are always friendly, and their service is extremely convenient. Just be sure to make a reservation- sometimes on the busier holidays they fill up and they won't valet park for you anymore (they used to but no longer). Alright, so surely by now you've seen that reviews for this new restaurant are *ALL OVER THE PLACE*, and there's a very good reason for that. This is a brand new restaurant and they're having a rough time with it- the waitstaff, from what I can tell, are extremely new to the game (our server today said it was her first day) and they're getting *MOBBED* with customers. We came here at just before 1pm and the place quickly filled to capacity. Now, if you've ever worked as a server, then you know that it is A FUCKING TOUGH AND THANKLESS JOB. And if you haven't ever worked as a server, then you can go fuck yourself and keep any opinion of the job to yourself, because you don't get to comment. So yeah, most of the waitstaff are young and brand new, and are having a tough time with the orders. It happens. Have some compassion and understanding, you bourgeoisie twats.  This place is nothing short of amazing. Full disclosure- I've only gotten delivery service from them, but WHAT an amazing service it has been! I very much look forward to visiting their actual restaurant, but as far as delivery, it's definitely some of the best. I really have to say, their food was knock-out good here. I ordered the mixed Kefta, and it knocked my socks off. Seriously. This place is solid. But you have to understand... it's kaiten-zushi. You won't be enjoying fat pieces of molten toro here, nor will the unagi be freshly broiled, succulent deliciousness. But if you just want a quick sushi fix, you could do a LOT worse. And I have to say- some of the things that I tried were REALLY tasty (the 'salmon nigi' was especially nice). This place genuinely is *as good as it gets*, in many ways. I feel that since my last review, they've genuinely upped their game significantly, so it's time to rewrite and re-evaluate everything. So I've decided that the service here can be as shitty as they want it to be, because the food is FUCKING AMAZING. Came here this morning and had their daily special- walnut-banana pancakes with bacon. Came here for a little snacky-poo, and had an enjoyable time. Their sushi is... fine. It's fine. Seems like they specialize in rolls, which isn't really my thing. They have a TON of variety, and I'd imagine that people come here mostly for that reason. Came here for a consultation last week, and went through the full procedure today. Got four wisdom teeth taken out. I was honestly a little apprehensive about it, because one of my lower teeth was VERY close to the nerve canal in my jaw, but as far as I can tell everything went really smoothly!! The entire office staff is really nice, and took the time to explain every aspect of both the procedure and the billing structure. Dr. Porter was really professional and had a pleasant demeanor.  A damned fine slice of NY Pizza, with a pretty decent list of toppings. Got delivery from here today- it was prompt, the pizza was tasty, the price was right, and it's good for what it's good for. NY Pizza isn't my favorite, but that won't stop me from giving this place a solid rating. They do what they do, and they're doing it well. I give them props for that. How did this little gem slip under my radar?!??! This place was just fine, on the closer edge of 'pretty good'. I'm giving it four stars, mostly because all of the one-two star ratings were written by idiots who should never have learned to use a keyboard in the first place. Seriously, anyone who calls this place 'overpriced' needs to reevaluate their financial decisions in life. I'm sorry, but someone who works at McDonalds really shouldn't have equal access to a culinary opinion as someone like me, who regularly eats diamonds just to make his dookie twinkle.  This is a solid pub, with solid food, a solid atmosphere, with solid offerings, having a solid variety. All in all, it's a solid place. They had a great selection of beers, and their burgers were damned tasty. The duck fat fries were delicious, but not as amazing as some people have made them out to be. They're damned good fries, and you can definitely taste a difference, but it's not something that absolutely changes the game.  \"I decided to up my rating for this place, because it is, in every way that matters to me, \"\"As good as it gets!\"\". I came by here today to place a really big takeout order Ordered some delivery from Tao Garden today via Doordash, and I can honestly say that it's a goddamned shame I haven't been here in so long. The shredded roast duck noodle soup is an absolute treat, with a really pleasant oily broth and nice chunks of tasty duck. The XO beef with green beans was wonderful, with a perfect texture contrasting between the crisp green beans and the softer but flavorful beef. The seafood with XO sauce was a winner, with large pieces of fresh seafood (fat scallops, chunks of squid, etc) with a little bit of spice to it via some stir-fried chilis. The Singapore style noodles were also amazing, with a nice little amount of spice that made you want to just suck in a mouthful and fill your cheeks with 'em. Alright, Mellow Mushroom. Ya done did good. They say that there are three rules in restaurants: We stopped by here for an after-workout meal, and I was immensely impressed. We had two lengua, one al pastor, one pescado, and one buche taco, along with some drinks and some of their homemade flan. Everything was absolutely delicious- exactly what I would have hoped for. They have roasted serranos if you want to add a little heat, and also some radishes if you need to cool your mouth down.  This is an outstanding little bakery inside of Lee Lee Market. You really owe it to yourself to come here!!! First off, get yourselves ready for some vulgarity. I have a LOT of great things to say about this restaurant, and absolutely zero tolerance for some of the douchepickles who have written reviews about it. That's right:  you're all a bunch of wanna-be foodies who need to keep your boojie ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boojie ) asses glued to the bars at Ra and Blue Wasabi. You don't deserve to eat at a place like this and no one wants to hear your opinions. Yup. This was the one. This spot is my go-to for delivery. Their food isn't amazing, but it's damned good. It won't blow you away, but it is what it needs to be. It's definitely a big step up from heat-lamp mall-style Chinese food, but definitely not an authentic join with a separate menu for Chinese locals.  This place is nice. Really, really nice. I came here for lunch and ordered up a bunch of sushi, and the service was great. Every single person who was employed here took a minute to at least say hi to me, and the environment was really warm (maybe just because it was slow, but it was impressive nonetheless). I never wanted for anything- the sushi chef was extremely attentive and personable, and my server made sure that my tea was hot, my water was topped-off, and a smile was on my face.  You know what? You need to up your Kmart game, playa. Oh biscuits... biscuits... you purveyor of breakfast goodness!!!! The only reason that I'm not giving this place five stars is because of the service. That's it- that's the only reason. It's not that they were rude at all- they were just your typical Asian restauranteurs:  indifferent, inscrutable, and inattentive. This is far from uncommon in many restaurants, so I can't really knock the points too much. But that, combined with the condition of the tables, was enough to knock a point off. Every table that wasn't occupied was dirty. Not filthy, mind you, but obviously they had only cleared the dishes from the previous occupants and not even wiped them down. Which, honestly, I could give less of a shit about, but I feel it necessary to point it out because I know that some people really get turned off by that. I dug this place. Got a great deal from Priceline, and I pretty much knew what to expect going in. I've stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn't really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days. Their pho is good, and they have plenty of other authentic offerings as well. If you're feeling adventurous, they have a few more... 'Vietnamese'... dishes, such as the tasty beef stew with cooked blood and pig knuckles (not really my things, but you should at least try it sometime- you might just love it!!)"
k6vOe0_qglL2PZlBldoKeQ,"omg, Omg, OMG!   I'll admit, I am a bit of a gypsy when it comes to nail salons.  I roam about the valley and when the mood strikes me, I will want a mani pedi (hence all the nail salon yelp reviews) so I go where ever is close at the time.  My salon wandering has come to an end now that I have found Biagio!  First off the place is immaculate, wonderful interior, clean and none of that chemical nail place smell.  This time I only got a pedi but was immediately was sat in a clean and new chair.  All the nail techs wear white smocks which is a nice professional touch so I don't have to stare at their bedazzled Baby Phat shirt.   Grimaldi's has always been one of my fav pizza places in the Valley.  I love how each location installs a water softener/filter to get their water just the way it is at the NYC location for the best pizza dough. The staff at Snyder and Wenner are passionate about helping those who have been harmed due to medical malpractice and are an asset to anyone looking for legal counsel.  They handle cases throughout the US but they are dedicated locally to the Phoenix area.  I would recommend them to anyone who questions the medical care they or a family member received. Went back for a pedi last night and it was great!  Got the sea salt and an added 15 minute leg massage for $35.  It was definitely worth the extra $$$. We were guests at the Tempe Buttes and decided to take in the full resort experience by dining at Top of the Rock.  I was able to make a reservation through Open Table (yay!) and added a simple request of a table with a view.  They were happy to accommodate us and we got a wonderful table right next to the NW facing windows.  TOR purchases locally for their ingredients and also gives a portion of the sales of specific items to local charities.  This place gets it. I have been wanting to try this place for years and finally had a chance to get here.  Being from the Midwest, I grew up with all sorts of Northern European dishes and Beaver Choice did not disappoint! I had forgotten how much I love Hobe Meats and was pleasantly reminded the other day.  Growing up in the Midwest, I am used to a butcher shop that cares about their cuts of meat as well as the quality and Hobe Meats does not disappoint in that regard! I test drove a car here during my car search and had a pleasant experience.  The salesman was pleasant, conversational, and also gave me my driver's license once he made a copy of it instead of holding it hostage.  He also apologized for the dirty exterior.  PHX had had a haboob and rain all day so there was no way the dealership could wash all the cars in that short of time but it was a nice touch that the agent that helped me took the time to acknowledge the issue.    I have dreams about Tacos Atoyac and they are the types of dreams you don't talk about.  I used to work close by to TA so I would come at least once a week to have lunch.  The Owner was always behind the register and always remembered my order (1 fish taco and an Oaxacan Hot dog).  He even remembered how I like my food (no tomatoes, no jalapenos, no side of grilled onions/peppers). I love me a good burger and 5 guys doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are ok for the price but the fries are a MUST order.  A regular order can feed 2-3 people because they don't skimp.  As a whole I would give this place 3 stars but they earned a 4th start for their online ordering system.  No waiting in line for this gal! Grabbed one of their bacon and egg Squarz at the Ahwatukee Farmers market and I wish I would have grabbed 10.  The filling was a little dry but the pastry was just plain delicious, the right combo of flaky and buttery.  I love that they deliver, have a brick and mortar restaurant, have frozen take home, AND hit up the Farmers Market.  All the ways to get my Squarz fix! The Ahwatukee Farmers Market, while smaller than other markets, is a great addition to the 'Tuk!  Selection depends on the day so I suggested coming multiple times.  Vendors pick and choose which days they want to set up shop so the line up is consistently changing. I live down the street from Scratch Pastries and LOVE their food.  I haven't sampled everything on their menu but recommend the Quiches, which size wise are big enough to share.  Their mushroom soup is awesome too, just make sure you aren't in a hurry if you order it because it does take some time as they make it as ordered.  Their house dressing is very tasty too.  Usually I avoid a vinaigrette like the plague but this one has a nice flavor without coming across too strong.  The color and consistency is a little weird but once you get past that, you are in salad heaven.   We have been searching for a new mattress for a few months now and are at our wits end to find one.  I had heard the advertisements on the radio (Shout out to Holmberg shilling away for T&N) and decided to give T&N a chance. Stopped by Petite for brunch on Sunday and it was delish!  I had their take on Eggs Benedict which was light and fresh and the eggs were perfectly poached.  My brunch companion had the chicken and mushroom stuffed crepes but we both got plate envy when we saw our neighbor table had ordered the Petite Maison burger!!  It was HUGE, a two hander and looked very juicy!   Shout out to today's lunch crew for great attitudes and energy!  Today was JM's Nationwide Day of Giving and 100% of today's sales in PHX will go directly to Phoenix Children's Hospital.   There is a place called Heaven, and it is a Bosa glazed donut.  The donut holes are the best and a real deal at 12 for $0.99.  It's not a quick stop though, Arcadia loves them some Bosa so there is always a line in the drive through.  But the wait in line for a fluffy pillow that is a Bosa donut is soooooo worth it. Angry Crab is a great addition to the Arcadia Neighborhood!  I haven't had their BBQ but their seafood is awesome.  I usually go with Snow Crab, they are cheap and already cleaned for you unlike the Dungeness that come whole and need to be cleaned.  I also love their shrimp which are a steal per lb and HUGE!  I am talking prawn size, cooked whole head on with all the delicious juices.   Harlow's Café is like that longtime friend you can't figure out why you stopped hanging out with.  Maybe it's because you were lured away by fancy brunch places with 90 min wait times but then you realize, all you needed was Harlow's. We just moved to North Scottsdale and hadnt unpacked the kitchen yet so I decided to check out Ristorante Giuseppe and get to go.  I have no idea it is CASH ONLY and only had my cards but the manager was super understanding.  I offered to hit the ATM at the bank in the complex but the manager didnt want me to incur the fees and told me to come back the next day with cash. We came back to the Attic for their Wednesday $12 Ivan and a Beer special and left two very happy and full campers. The Boy has been wanting to stop by The Larder + Delta for some time now after our last visit. We were afforded the opportunity to stop by and were not disappointed. And my 200th Yelp review goes to......................  Lash Out! \"Another Great dinner at P&P.  We had a small hiccup during service, but our server and the management address it and all was forgiven.  Our server, Cat, was AMAZING.  She made great recommendations that the table talked about for the rest of the night.  She recommended the special, a Pork \"\"Chicken Wing\"\" which everyone raved over (sorry Beckets is a great addition to Arcadia and with a couple visits under my belt I figured I should add my review to Yelp.  I love their drink selection, lots of tasty and fresh combinations as well as local beer selection (yah!) and a great wine list. The Boy and I decided to try Ingo's for their 4th of July Special, $4 burgers.  I have warred with this place since it was built and took away the already scant parking for LGO and Postino's but I think it's time to wave the white flag and concede to Ingo's Tasty Food. I got a spray tan here from the owner, Manae for Halloween and not only was it awesome, affordable and quick but I had a blast!  I would def recommend her to anyone who is looking for a quick and inexpensive spray.  I have a crazy work schedule but she was very accommodating fitting me in past 7 PM and even gave me a glass of wine.  Her spray set up isn't super fancy but she did a great job and the spray was good quality so my tan looked natural.  Plus she is hilarious so it was more like hanging out with a friend than getting sprayed by a total stranger.  She gives discounts on spray packages and gives one free once you purchase ten but at $20 a spray I will keep coming back even without the special discounts! Stopped by here on a Friday night to catch the tail end of their HH and had a great time!  Their happy hour lasts until 7 PM which is nice for us folks who don't get off work until 6 PM and included some great rolls and appetizers like a crispy spicy tuna and Las Vegas Roll as well as a Sapporo Tall Boy Saki Bomber for $5.  The regular priced specialty rolls were a nice change from the same old same old rolls you see at other sushi joints, I ordered the original tootsie pop which came on sticks and were rolled in thin sliced cucumber.  I would like to see their specialty roll prices be a little more affordable as most of their specialty rolls range from $13-25 but the quality of the food is definitely A+. I have been coming to Hanny's for years and it never disappoints.  Normally we come for drinks and a bar plate while we wait for even traffic to die down but this time we came for a sit down meal and it was AMAZING!   Saw the reviews on yelp and thought I better check out what all the stars were all about.  I went for a regular Pedicure ($19 to start) on a random Tuesday afternoon.  It is your typical strip mall nail salon but was very clean and nice inside.   Run, don't walk to Dr Hummus.  I know there is no such thing as a doctorate in Hummus but if there was, this guy would get the first one issued.   Another great trip to the Aveda Chandler Store!  I was having a quality issue with a product as well as needed to purchase some Xmas Gifts and decided to stop in.  The ladies who were working were happy to exchange my product, were outgoing and helpful, and even made sure I knew about some new changes going on with their rewards program. Finally a bar who knows how to treat their customers!  I love the fact that their happy hour runs 5-9 PM every day instead of a measly 2 hour one like the stingy places.   I mean, who actually ENJOYS going to get waxed?  It hurts and is annoying and you have a relative stranger poking around at your business for 20-30 minutes.  I went to Rio for the first time and would absolutely recommend it hands down over any other wax place in the valley!  I didn't have the famed Danielli but my waxologist Sara was amazing!  She had me laughing the entire time which is hard when the anticipation has your reflexes on high alert.  Sara was also great to talk about what I was looking for so I didn't walk away with too much taken off or too little. Every summer, the Gypsies would come to our little town to set up shop and sell their wares. which included pillow cleaning and re-ticking. Since Phoenix seems to have a shortage on Gypsies, I have had a hard time finding places who clean and refresh feather pillows until I stumbled across Rave. This place should be called Magic OMFG Noodle because it was soooooooo gooooooood!   Fluff and Fold, you complete me!!  I haven't used their do it yourself area but I do take advantage of their fluff and fold service and it is amazing.  They charge $1 per pound (most loads are under 7 lbs) and wash, dry and fold your clothes.  They provide the detergent and will ask if you prefer fabric softener or even bleach on your whites. People always wonder why I spend $$$ on quality sunglasses vs buying them from the knock-off kiosk in the mall.  Optical Shops of Aspen proves my point.   I have been eyeing Mr. Z's through my dusty car windows for a while now and decided to give them a try. I opted for the full service wash with the 30 day wax. Stopped by B&R on a Saturday to treat myself after a hard (ok not so hard) day of over time.  I love that they offer all day happy hour in the bar and took advantage of their specials. Stopped by on an errand for The Boy to pick up a few things and was in and out in no problem.  The staff was super helpful and there was always someone who asked me if I was finding everything I needed, which I did need help because where does one find a 4 oz jar of spackle in a mega store of DIY? Mod Home is a cool place if you are looking for modern (duh) or eclectic pieces you wouldn't find in a regular furniture store.  This place has something for every style from Art Decco, to fuzzy pillows, to minimal modern pieces, to giant decorative busts, they even have a framing area to order custom picture frames.  Somethings are a little far out there, like an Egg Chair from Men in Black, but everything seemed to be of high quality and well done. I am slacking.  This is seriously one of the BEST places in PHX and I have yet to review it!  This place cares about its food and about Arcadia.   During our search for a new mattress, we decided to shop local and give R&S a try.  The associate who helped us, Doug, was amazing.  He was helpful, listened to our concerns, and made some great recommendations for the types of mattresses we should look for to meet our needs. Update on my review, still 5 stars! Love this place and come several times a week.  I have no idea why you would go to any other bagel place in a 5 mile radius, well except on Mondays when they are closed. We stopped by BW3 (Ohio baby!) during our most recent trip to the mall for lunch and I was very impressed. I LOVE NCounter!  They do breakfast well and have great dishes that are imaginative without going off the deep end.  If you like a Benedict and you are wild about cream cheese get the NCounter Omelets!  Seriously it is my go to item and it's like crack.  I also love that they have a protein smoothie on their menu so I enjoy my brunch with my man friend instead of getting stuck at some health food place. We used Head Out to Rocky Point for a trip over the 4th of July weekend and I am very impressed!  We chartered a 12 person passenger van with a small trailer to take us to, and from RP over the holiday weekend.  It was $100 per person plus tipfor the trip there and back and was totally worth it.  Our driver, David, was very nice, he helped us load and unload our trailer and kept us informed of stops and any necessary border info we needed to be aware of.  The trailer was a nice touch as well, we were able to store all our luggage and not be cramped in the van as well as had room to bring our own lawn games, chairs, and any other items allowed across the border. My friends and I started coming to Hazelwoods for their Thursday night trivia and always have a blast!  Not only do they have a great happy hour but they also have nightly drink specials depending on the day of the week.  Besides Team Trivia, they also organize card games on specific nights (sorry I'm not sure what kind though).  I also love their beer selection, 16 beers on tap! A double Vienna beef dog with all the fixings and fresh hand cut fries for $4.35, how can you go wrong?  You can't beat their prices or the food quality and they have a great menu that makes me think I am in Chicago.  I do get my order to go since the fryer smell will linger with you throughout the day but always worth the trip! Came here for a change of pace activity with the boy and had a great time!  We rented a double kayak but there are several options to choose from including stand up paddle boards, paddle boats, and electric passenger boats.  If you are looking for something with a little more horse power, they have motor based boats, jet skis and Fly Boards rentals at their Lake Pleasant location. o...m...g  amazing!!!  I tend to stick to their beef items but everything I have had is amazing.  It's a garlic lovers paradise with their garlic rice and Tzatziki sauce and their portions are HUGE.  My only gripe is their fries since I am not a thick steak fry person but I just get their plate meal that comes with entrée, small greek salad, garlic rice and a pita with a side of Tzatziki sauce.  The dining area is small and the place can fill up quickly during lunch but totally worth the wait! This guy is AWESOME!  Yes all capital letters AWESOME!  We saw him perform at the yelp PleY date and wanted to pull up a chair and watch him all night.  He was entertaining, engaging and also talented with balloon art (no crappy giraffes here).  I want to throw a party just so I have a reason to hire him. Murphy's Law is alive and well.  I went to grab to go food on a Friday night and came back to a dead car parked in the 10 min To Go parking.  Great.  Having no regular mechanic to call, I had my car towed to SDA and prayed to the car repair gods not to be taken to the cleaners. \"This is my go to spot to say in Old Town!  Unlike other resorts you aren't charged a resort fee and other \"\"staycation\"\" fees are minimal like $14 valet parking\\/$5 for non guests for the day instead of $30 like other places. \"I used Parker's Movers back when they were known as \"\"Smooth Moves\"\" and would recommend them to anyone! When I first looked at going to Little Miss, they had over 386 Yelp reviews and still maintained a 5 Star rating.  Not a 4.5, not a 4.7, but a 5 freaking star rating and I knew I had to find this Unicorn. Before I start my review, this is a SCHOOL.  These are students who are learning a craft and by going there, you should understand the services may not be perfect.  It blows my mind how many bad reviews there are for students who are trying to learn a trade and need practice to learn that trade.  They are not experts (yet) and will make mistakes, take longer to do the services, and have to check their work with the Cosmo Prof on the floor before you can leave to get clock hours for the service. I go out of my way to get my gas here.  Why? The staff is always courteous, the store is clean and their gas prices are consistently $0.08-$0.15 cents cheaper than other stations just down the block.  Combine that with the fact they accept Fry's Fuel Points and it really lessens the blow of dropping $$$ to fill up your tank. The dine in theater here is a lot of fun and a nice option, especially if you are already planning on dinner before a movie.  The quality of the food is just ok, but if you aren't expecting gourmet fancy pants food, it's pretty good.  Our server was attentive and helpful as well. I love the fresh pressed tortillas at Panchero's!  No more dry, flour-y tortillas for this gal and I love the variety of menu items they have.  I hate to use the C-Word (cough, cough, Chipotle) but that place doesn't compare to the delicious flavors and fresh, chewy tortillas at Panchero's. By a fluke, I ended up at DVAP looking for a master cylinder and brake booster for a 1962 Oldsmobile Starfire.  My father in Iowa owns the car and had the ordinal part split while being worked on and was able to track down a similar year model at DVAP.  In comes his favorite child to the rescue! Do you love Beer?  Do you love Brauts? Do you love Bocce?  Do you love Bing Pong (sorry I needed another B word there)?  The Brat Haus is the place for you! Hate the wait, hate the prices but I love the Breakfast Club!  The food is amazing and the menu is extensive for plain old breakfast food.  The portions are large which is great if you are starving or hung over but I wish they had some of their larger items like the omelets ala cart.  I love their a la cart breakfast sandwich, it's like an adult egg McMuffin with horseradish sauce on it.  I don't love the price.  At over $5 for just a sandwich I'll head to across the canal to Olive and Ivy's market and get a sandwich and home fries for $7.  And if you like pancakes?  O....M....G! I have died and gone to pizza heaven.  No literally this place is pizza heaven!  My go to pizza is the Tirolese which is so good I really don't order anything else.   As a Midwesterner, I have been waiting since the announcement that Lou's was coming to the Valley.  I even taunted friends who have moved outside of the Chicagoland area that we have the first Lou's outside of IL and was extremely lucky to score a ticket to the soft opening. We stopped by Mor on our quest for the perfect dining table and bedroom set.  While we didnt find what we were looking for, we still had a great experience.  One of the sales people was extremely helpful, talked to us like people and not like a sale, and really made the whole experience. I've been coming here for a few months now to get a blow out for special events or just when I am feeling lazy.  At $10 you can see why I call it my guilty pleasure!   \"This is one of those places where you question \"\"are we really supposed to be here?!\"\" But once enter Pizza A \"Had lunch here with the coworkers and pretty sure I am going to dream of this place later tonight when I fall asleep.  The menu boasts 13 different \"\"dawg\"\" choices as well as burgers Is anyone else tired of being forced to Valet your car in Scottsdale?  Ok I can already hear my fellow Yelpers rolling their eyes since I live and go out in Scottsdale but seriously when did it become ok to make a living over public parking? No one enjoys going car shopping.  Seriously, give your friend the choice of helping you move and helping you buy a car and most will chose helping you move.  The experience I had at Audi Chandler made me want to buy a car from them AND help THEM move. I was a first timer at Drybar but not a first timer for a blow out.  I really enjoyed my experience.  My stylist help me pick a style based on my hair cut (I wanted curls but wasn't sure which of their styles would match my blunt cut) and I was not disappointed with the result. So for my b-day cake I have a theory, if you have to get older, you better celebrate with the best cake you can find and this year I decided to try Butter and Me.  Prob the best idea of my new age.  I requested a cake version of a cupcake variety I had had a few years previous at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, chocolate cake with brown sugar butter cream and bacon toffee bits on top.  I wasn't sure what shape/size of cake I wanted but Kelly was very helpful and accommodating.  The cake was spectacular and she had added a little glitter so it was pretty and girly but not garish.  And the Brown Sugar Buttercream?  O......M....G!  I could eat it every day of my life it was so good and hands down one of the best frostings I have ever tasted.   I went to Allure Nails the other day for a Mani/Pedi before I took off on vacation.  The salon is very nice, your typical cookie cutter nail salon but it was clean and the décor was modern and very nice.  They have a flat screen which faces away from the technicians so you don't have your tech paying more attention to Court TV than to your nails. We visited Sushi Ken because it is cold and rainy so of course that left us wanting RAMEN!  We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday and the place was surprisingly busy.  By the time we left, all the tables were full as was the sushi bar, and there was a wait! I LOVE this place!  Their prices have risen a bit to $2.25 but that is for ANY type of garment.  Other places charge your $15-20 to dry clean a dress but this place is $2.25 straight across the board.  They offer same day service too for the unbelievable price of $2.25!!!  I was so surprised when I asked for same day service that they didn't jack up the price but when they say they have a fixed price list, they mean it!! \"Order in, drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme).  They \"\"get\"\" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive through. \"People always judge me because I go to the \"\"ghetto\"\" Fry's but seriously they do a great job.  Everyone is always so helpful and courteous to me and since the remodel the store has done a 180.  They have also increased their food selection since the remodel which is great. I have been a fan of the Bistro Family since their sister restaurant, Local Bistro, opened in the Grey Hawk area.  I was super excited when Central Bistro brought their love to the Arcadia area. We came here on a whim after another restaurant had a 45 min wait on a Friday night and had a very nice time.  There were a few hiccups, which are to be expected at this type of establishment, but over all we were very impressed. \"I am not good with blood, like at all, so when my doc suggested I get some yearly labs done I cringed and thought about \"\"accidentally\"\" losing the 'script.  Everything thing about my experience with Sonora Quest helped ease my fears.  This location takes appointments which is AWESOME!  No getting there at 7 AM and hoping there aren't 20 \"\"regulars\"\" there that you have to wait behind while praying you can make it to work on time.  I booked online Another 5 star review from Shayna's Nails because I get 5 Star treatment!  Kathy was amazing and actually remembered me.  It has been months since I came in yet she still remembered me, my preferences for services, and even the type of polish I use.  I did add a few bells and whistles to my treatment since it had been months since my feet say any love and affection but I was still out the door for under $35 sans tip. Been tanning here since they opened and love the place.  Even though they only have 6 tanning beds and the spray, I always get in and out quickly and never have to wait like other places that have 20+ beds.  I've tried all of their beds and each level does a great job of getting you nice and brown and are always clean.  Other places make you pay monthly and then prepay to pay to upgrade your bed but not here.  Their pricing structure is reasonable and straight-forward too, I have a monthly membership and then pay to upgrade every now and then to boost my bronzing.   After months of searching, we FINALLY found the right dining room set at Living Spaces.  We went everywhere (as you can see from my previous reviews) and were having no luck, either nice sets for $$$ or cheap, bad veneer work for $.  All of that went away when we stopped at Living Space. The Boy took me to Don and Charlie's for my yearly anniversary of NOT getting older and we really enjoyed our experience!  Don and Charlie's has a lot of charm as that neighborhood restaurant where you take your family or meet your buddies after golf. Another amazing trip to Valley Eye Care! I had Flex Spending to use and it has been years since I have gotten new frames so I decided to splurge.   Came here for dinner and was not disappointed!  Our server Danyella was attentive and also very helpful.  The hostess made sure to ask if we were celebrating a special event (just the celebration of eating) and Danyella also checked about the occasion so she could make it memorable.   I am a vain person, let's be honest.  I have had eyelash extensions in the past but they are more of a luxury for me so I save them for special occasions.  The salon I went to previously doubled their prices so I was in search for a new lash-master to help me get my glam on. \"I have a love hate relationship with LGO.  I LOVE their food!  I hate that I never know if they are doing counter service only or if they have servers in the dining area.  I LOVE their pizza!  I hate their parking and now they've turned all their lot spaces into \"\"19 min only\"\" parking so you have to valet.  I LOVE their take and go options as well as you can buy wine at retail price in the grocery and drink it in the dining room with no corking fee.  I hate that this is a place that attracts hipsters. \"I have been going to Mikhail for almost 7 years now which is the longest I have stayed with one man in my life. :)  Mikhail is so talented in his craft that I really don't bring in pictures of what I want anymore.  I just sit in his chair, give him an idea (keep the length but I want more movement) and say \"\"work your magic\"\" and he does!  In our time together so far I have had long layered hair as well as many variations of the \"\"Posh Spice\"\" bob and I have always been happy.  He takes the time to look at your face and bone structure and then creates a perfect cut based on that. I LOVE me some 5th and Wine.  Not only for the wine selection but for their great food.   I swear our car is a rock magnet. We have had 2 windshields replaced by Mr. Glassworks and would recommend them to anyone! Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go. We moved to the neighborhood and Salty Sow is my new guilty pleasure.  Their menu has a lot of fun yet wholesome items that I can't get enough of.  Both myself and The Boy were surprised by their brussel sprout Caesar salad.  The dressing has the right amount of bite and the crispy brussel sprout leaves give it a nice bump in flavor. This place is legit, local owned, local made, local good!  We've been here a few times now and always enjoy our time. The Boy and I decided we earned another cheat meal this week (ok we really didn't) and we spent it a the Gladly.  We came on Sunday and had a pleasant surprise of all day Happy Hour on Sunday until 6 PM.  Don't threaten me with a good time.   I know I have been slacking on my Yelp reviews, The Boy and I are diet which explains the radio silence.  We get one cheat meal a week and decided to try Dozo for some Ramen Cheat. I don't come here as often I used to, due to them removing their gas pumps, but I always have a pleasant visit.  The owners are very friendly and courteous.  The location of the store can be a bit sketch, but the store is always clean and they actively work on removing graffiti on the outside of the store. I was so excited when DD opened up since I love me some liquor with my breakfast (sorry Breakfast Club).  It became our new go to breakfast spot and never disappointed.  I am a huge fan of their benedicts especially their crab cake bene.  My friends are healthy eaters and always raved about their Egg White wrap or the Turkey and Sausage White out.  Servers were always helpful and courteous, even when my hung over friend had random requests like 2 medium poached eggs and wheat toast no butter.  Mimosas are great here too so make sure you aren't hung over to get one."
3egcdazws_x1wW35jgXfNw,"Nothing beats a beautiful sunny day and a stroll along the streets of the strip district in downtown Pittsburgh.  Apollo Cafe is one of the best breakfast spots in downtown Pittsburgh. Apollo opens early for those early workers to have a hot meal before starting the morning shift. I love the Mediterranean/Greek feel to the atmosphere of the cafe. The food is very good and at an affordable price for eat in or take out. I have always enjoyed the friendly staff that greets you in the morning to start your day with a smile.  We had such a wonderful Wine Tasting Cruise !  I highly recommend this cruise once a moth for those wine lover such as myself.  Primanti Bros is a staple in our house!. It is very true, you either love them or hate them.  We LOVE them.  I have even gone so far as to try to make my own at home. We have been eating Primanti's since the early 70's when the only place I knew of at the time was the strip district. Then several more popped up in all the right places. I am not as fond of the restaurant style they have now moved into, I still like the quick shop for a sandwich. The restaurant don't offer the quick service that the small sandwich shops do. It is nice to have a choice when you have kids with you.  The North Versailles is my least favorite, but it is the closest. The service is good here, but time from taking order to receiving isn't all that great. Monroeville isn't bad, either, slow service.  I still prefer the Strip District. They closed my favorite on Cherry Way, downtown, for a more of restaurant location in Market Square, just isn't the same.  The location in Oakland on campus is hard to get to when you can't find a parking space.  For the most part we have received a good sandwich, every now and then the bead was cut to small or the slaw was to over powering. For the most part it has been consistent. We have never had other restaurant foods either than the sandwiches. I have been meaning to try the pizza fest, but not as of now.   My Granddaughter and I attended the Pierogi Festival at Kennywood, this past weekend. She and I both loved Gosia's Pierogis.   Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza !!!  LOVE THE WINGS  I am not a wing person don't care for them in other restaurants, but I just love the coal fired wings at Anthony's. The caramelized onions and focaccia bread make these wings to die for !!   I have no negative review of this trip to LongHorn.  Excellent new bakery in The Waterfront in Homestead. They just opened in July and already a buzz around town about them.  The Burnt Almond Torte is PHENOMENAL!  and to die for !!  Lotus Food, If I could shop there every day I would. I always shop when I am in the strip district for the afternoon, mostly on the weekends.  The family ordered from Kar Hing this evening. 2 Shrimp Egg Rolls , Shrimp Fried Rice, Chicken /w Mixed Vegetables and Beef Lo Main.  After a really nice morning in the museum, a trip to the cafe was just as nice.  While shopping in the waterfront in Homestead, we decided to make a second trip to P.F Changs. Our first visit was an evening for dinner with reservations. I truly enjoyed the evening. The Asian Grilled Salmon with dry rub was not overly spicy, just as I like it. I just acquired a taste for asparagus and enjoyed it as well. Remembering our dinner, we stopped for lunch this trip. We had a gift card for our lunch that day. The restaurant wasn't crowed so no reservation was needed. It was a Monday afternoon. I like the decor and the atmosphere of the dining room. I ordered the weekday lunch paring. California Roll, and Vegetable Spring Roll and added the Egg Roll , it was really good!, would definitely order again. The service was great, friendly and very accommodating to us. The gift card helped to absorb some of the cost. The cost is appropriate for what you receive, but some will say it is still too expensive. As many have posted it is not your typical Chinese restaurant, more like a California yuppie vibe, but I like it. It's clean, neatly laid out and it offers a great decor and atmosphere. If you're willing to spend the money it is worth it. I would say, I would be back if I had another gift card or certificate. I have been riding horses from a very young age. No longer having horses in the family, I have had to find opportunities to ride. I have since shared my love of horses with my granddaughter, who also loves to ride. I never knew that Rolling Hills Ranch, was so close to home.  Tillie's Restaurant is a wonderful kid and family friendly Italian Restaurant. I have been coming to Tillie's since a young child. My parents knew Tillie. She was a wonderful old women that was always nice to me. Her picture hangs in the dining room, a beautiful tribute.  Chinatown Inn is the BEST CHINESE RESTURANT I have found in North America! HUGE FAN! and have been supporting Chinatown for over 25+ years. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I have had lunch in , dinner in and have had take out numerous times over the years. Chinatown has NEVER disappointed me once. I love the Shrimp Eggs Rolls, Chicken & Broccoli in the white sauce with steamed rice. I live for the Won Ton Soup !! it is so unique that they shred the pork on top of the soup and not inside the wrapper, I love that. I always get a medium bowl and a medium steamed rice on the side. After I eat the won ton, I put the rice in the soup and enjoy two soups from one bowl. Won Ton, and Chicken and Rice. The Jumbo Egg Roll is a meal in itself. Everything on the menu is good.  The Southside Works Cinema is a great place for a movie & dinner, when planning an evening on the Southside. We made a mistake in buying tickets one evening and the Manager was very friendly and resolved our issue at once with no hassle. I haven't had an issue with employees or the freshness of the popcorn. We usually have popcorn and a bottle of water when watching the movies. It is a nice small, clean theater. I can't comment on the seats in the theater, I have sat on worse. Others have commented on the sound, I can't comment, It never was a concern or an issue that caused me to notice. Our movie experiences have been great!. I would highly recommend this theater. They do offer advance tickets in the entertainment books in the area if you are able to find them. A Birthday Celebration brought us to Bonefish. The birthday girls favorite restaurant.  Although never seeing a Manager during our dinner, I have to say the food was great, prepared to everyone's liking. Quick and friendly service. We started our dinner with the amazing crispy, fried, spicy Bang Bang Shrimp!!, as an add on to our dinner.  I would love to have the recipe to make this at home! We also shared the Crab Cakes, delicious! We all chose the Hooked on Tues Specials. Salad, entree and dessert. The birthday girl had the Salmon dinner, I had the Ahi Tuna and her father had the Shrimp & Scallops. I chose the Ceaser Salad. It was good, but lacking in dressing. I really enjoyed the medium well Tuna, it was prepared perfectly. Everyone had the Potatoes, excellent choice. Dessert was Cheesecake with both butterscotch and chocolate sauce, very good !!! I belong to the email subscription. I have not yet joined the rewards program. We do go to Bonefish or Out Back Steak House enough to join. We gave her the points to her rewards account to get one more visit for a dinner reward.  I may consider it. We will return. I really can't say enough about Chick-fil-A in Monroeville. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed in any way. Not sure if it perfect timing or what, but we have hardly any wait time and have always found a seat.  Excellent Breakfast! Biroche Doree is a French European chain style cafe, located inside the University Club on the Pitt campus. It is a hidden gem away from the hectic business of the university campus and hospital complexes. It is a small, quiet, clean and cozy little cafe. For those that are looking for something a little different, for breakfast or a quick lunch this is your spot. The cafe has many coffees and teas available all day. Biroche has pastries and cafe style sandwiches available as well. I have enjoyed the breakfast croissants and bagels. For lunch I usually ordered The Quiche Lorraine. Biroche is only open for breakfast and the lunch till 4 pm, during the week and closed on Saturday & Sundays. I am a little bias as well to this lovely little cafe, I once was employed by the University Club and had the chance to eat here every day. Highly Recommend. Aug 8th  The kids love the Sbarro's at the Monroeville Mall Food Court. The pizza is always fresh. They also love the rolls. The price is reasonable.  We have been to Green Forest many times, one of our favorite Brazilian Steakhouses. Unlimited meat, excellent salad bar, and delicious meat, bread and cheese table. $45 dollars a person is well worth the price. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. We enjoy brining family here on special occasions, like the one this evening for our daughter's birthday. Six of us enjoyed a very wonderful dinner.  Gia Visto is a wonderful authentic Italian restaurant hidden gem of Monroeville. Gia by far is the best restaurant in Monroeville. I have been here several times and have not been disappointed once. The quality of food and the service are top notch.  who hasn't had a slice of Mineo's Pizza ? it's been a Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill tradition since 1958. It is true you either love it or hate it. It's fierce competition up the street is Aiello's is quit the same, either you love them or hate them. I have been eating slices of Mineo's since the late 70's  * NOTE:  Cash Only  I truly love shopping here. It is great for weekly shopping or a quick in and out. It's not a huge as some of the new GE's but it's big enough to move around and find everything your looking for.  When we travel we like to stay at Hyatt if I can book a room. We belong also to the reward program they offer. I collect the points for free night stays as so many now do. I like the Hyatt brand hotels and enjoy staying when possible.  I love Cheese steaks as you may have read from prior posts.  I have never been disappointed at Uncle Sam's. I have only been to this location and the one in the Waterworks in Aspinwall, next to another favorite place Burgatory. Uncle Sam's Submarines is located on Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill.  In my option this cheese steak is much better than any pizza shop steak hoagie and I think it is because Sam's specializes in great steak hoagies. The steaks are made in front of you, always fresh and never a so-so hoagie.  I like the fact that, If you eat in, you get free fries. I like the small thin shoestring fries, they remind me of the fries on the boardwalk. The staff here and in the Waterworks have always been friendly. I think that the price is very affordable for what you receive. The restaurant is always clean and I have never had a problem finding a seat. Yes it is CASH ONLY. Highly Recommend for a great Cheesesteak! I can only comment on the cheesecake. We have had dinner there once or twice, but I found nothing negative or glowing to say about the dinners. It's always to crowded to make this place on our restaurant rotation list.  I LOVE the cheesecake. Either eat in or take out, it is such a treat! We mostly like to take the dessert out, less crowded and have it in the peace and quite of a hotel room near by or at home. I love the Raspberry/Chocolate every time ! True fan and will continue to eat Cheesecake and recommend to family and friends. I love the new look of the Arby's in Monroeville! Clean, fresh and new !  Me Lyng Restaurant has been a part of Homestead for as long as I can remember. A friend and I stopped for dinner one evening, knowing I enjoy Chinese food, it was a great choice and so pleased with the entire evening. It was my first time there. I ordered of course, the Chicken w Broccoli.  This was my first visit ever to a BRAVO and loved the whole experience from the moment I walked in the door with a girlfriend for a girls night out.  Who doesn't LOVE the Zoo.  We have traveled over three states to visit the zoo's in other states. This is our fifth year of being members of the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium we love the advantages of how wonderful the visits are for our grandchildren as well as a health walk for us. The zoo has changed in the many years as a child, I would visit with my parents as well as brining our children and now a third generation. I love all the improvements, new exhibits and the sights and sounds of the zoo. It is a wonderful day for young and old. Our grandkids love the new dinosaur exhibit for them, the small $5.00 a person up-charge was worth it. It is only here till the Sept 2017.    Shady Grove was always a favorite place to go after work for dinner or a weekend lunch break, when living and working on Fifth Avenue in Shadyside. The food and the service has always been excellent. I have never had a bad experience dining at Shady Grove. It is also a great place for a Sunday Brunch. I love the salads. My favorite is the Chicken Ceaser. I also like the Ahi Tuna. You can't beat a $3 Mimosa on a Sunday.  I look forward to concerts at this old historic concert hall. The history of this hall alone is worth the visit. I also like the library attached to the music hall. Old and classic in many ways. This small venue gives  a unique feel and great view from any balcony seat, there is truly not a bad seat in the house. Tickets to an event should be purchased as soon as possible to most concerts, they do sell out fast and they have many on the hall list that purchase as soon as the list appears.  We have seen, Kenny Wayne Sheppard and many other performers here, and the staff has always been so helpful and friendly. * side note, they are always looking for volunteers to staff the events. It's a great way to help community and see free concerts.  I agree with others that have stated that for a chain restaurant, Olive Garden is good. I do like the Mom/Pop restaurants, but sometimes a chain isn't bad. Being a prior restaurant owner and someone in the industry for 20+ years, I can appreciate, good food and good service. I am not a fan of fast food, but something quick, we make it due. Olive Garden in Monroeville has been a great spot for us as take out and dining in. I like the new pay at the table service with the tablet you find on all the tables. The kids enjoy the games if you're willing to pay for the service. The kids menus are great and keeps them busy with the actives on the page.  I usually order the Endless Soup and Salad. I love the Pasta Fagioli. I have tried the copycat version but I like the in restaurant better. We have also purchased the salad dressing. Good Stuff! The Stuffed Mushrooms are great always and I like the Fried Ravioli.  We have not had a bad experience and have had dinner and lunch there with a small group and with a larger group of family. Service either dining in or take out has always been, quick and friendly. I am starting to really like the take out service! At PointBreezeway, We had our daughters wedding shower there, thanks to Lauren & Riley ( the adorable family dog), the shower was a huge success! We couldn't have asked for a more attentive and helpful hostess in Lauren. The space is warm, cozy, and so gorgeous, we were able to comfortably fit 35 women in the indoor space, a thou it was winter and we could not use the outdoor space, which is truly an extra bonus, for those wishing to expand space and flow indoors and outdoors, we would have to wait for another event to use the beautiful renovated patio.  I just loved the Penn and Teller show.  The magic , the comedy and their whit and humor went hand in hand to produce a wonderful show.  I was told that they change the shows regularly, I am excited to come back to see another great show!  Highly recommend if you're in Vegas to see this show, it will not disappoint. A must see on the Sin City bucket list. I loved shopping here at the Direct Market on Center Ave, when I lived in Shadyside. I still come back from time to time.  The young and old in our family has enjoyed a yearly visit to the Carnegie Museum. We have been visiting since the early 70's to date. The museum is an affordable educational and fun afternoon for everyone! This is a great afternoon any time of the year. This is a great place to bring visiting family and friends.  This review is for the Casino only, I can't comment on the room's we have always stayed next door at Grandview with our timeshare. I love coming to Vegas and we have always enjoyed South Point Casino.  They have so much to offer under one roof and it isn't just a casino. They have a 64 lane bowling alley that they use for tournaments as well as guest play. A Cinemark movie theater. Huge booking areas. My favorite the horse equestrian center.  Being from the East, I don't get to see the real Cowboy Stuff and I enjoy sitting and watching.  I have read all the negative reviews but I can't offer one. I really enjoyed our last visit. We made a reservation on open table for a Sunday afternoon. We were the first ones through the door. We have only been to the South Side Location.  The restaurant was clean and ready for the day. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our special occasion. It was a Birthday celebration.  We have always enjoyed the pizza and Gyro's. Homemade Gyro's from a spit not frozen. Great service! Very friendly and accommodating to children. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend. A trip to the Strip District, Downtown Pittsburgh isn't a good day unless I have stoped at Wholeys for lunch.  They offer the best cod fish sandwich combo with fries, coleslaw and a drink.  Who would have ever thought a really great Sushi place would be inside a fish market !?!  I LOVE Cheesesteak hoagies.  Carhops has the best so far that I have had in Monroeville. I have followed them from their old location in Monroeville, to the newest one. It's a huge jem hidden in Monroeville in a strip mall on Business 22, next to Elmer's Aquarium. I have not been to the Strip District location.  As an old car lover, the car names on the menu items are awesome!! They offer two sizes: 1ft Coupe and 2ft Sedan how clever is that !! I love the Deville ( cheesesteak ) the Riviera (steak, cheese with grilled mushrooms) and the Z-28 (steak, grilled onions, white american cheese I ask with no garlic). They offer Italian hoagies as well, and other sandwiches, but I go for the Cheesesteak. I am not a Penn Station fan, just something not right about them for me. I enjoy watching the owner make the hoagies, he has always been friendly and pleasing to talk to. The steaks are always made fresh and I have never had a bad experience. This is not a restaurant per say. Yes they have a few tables to sit at, but it's more for takeout. You seat yourself and get your own drinks. If you're looking for waiter service this is not for you, but if you really want a great cheesesteak, I highly recommend. CASH ONLY !  They are closed on Sundays. They do deliver in the Monroeville area. What a unique cart return escalator !! This Target location in East Liberty is off the beaten path for me, but when I get a chance to shop here I take it !!  We really enjoyed our first visit to Olives & Peppers.  I read the negative reviews. I can't say the family's experience was a negative one. The kids had a great time! It wasn't overly crowded and we found a table rather quickly. Babysitting this weekend, I asked what pizza to order. Bishops !! was the only suggestion answered. I was glad to hear it.  Such a GREAT Day !! Kennywood afternoon & evening makes great family memories.  We have used Mitch's Barbecue for many of our family functions and occasions. I have recommend Mitch to many of our friends, who have also used him for picnics and graduations. Mitch and his wife are wonderful to deal with, friendly and accommodating to all my special food needs. He has always been on time and followed all the venues requirements. The food is Excellent!!. The staff the Mitch hires are friendly and helpful.  I was sooooo disappointed when they closed Noodles & Company in Monroeville.  \"My Family was raised in Greenfield. Great working class neighborhood, where everyone looks out and knows one another. I was never raised in Greenfield but still have family close by. Big Jim's has and always will be our family neighborhood restaurant. Big Jim's \"\"In The Run\"\" it's not a huge restaurant I was excited when Pittsburgh built the Rivers Casino. It rivals the Meadows in Washington County. It isn't as flashy or lavish as those in Vegas or Atlantic City or other city casinos I have been to. Rivers is boring and plan, but it's home. As accessible by car, bus or the T. Parking is free.  Triangle Bar & Grill I just LOVE the new look of the Aldis on the Ardmore Blvd in Forest Hills.  Mitchell's Fish Market in Homestead is my favorite fish restaurant in the area. At one time I knew the head chef, but he has since moved on.  I really like the food here, which keeps us coming back again and again.  I think that management needs improved in some areas, but that doesn't keep me from enjoying the food.  When I lived in Shadyside I would order from China Palace once a week. It was in my Walnut Street restaurant rotation. I have taken out and have had dinner there. I have had most of the Chicken dishes, with Broccoli, Snow Peas, Cashew, Sweet & Sour, Mixed Veg, the Fried Rice and other Chicken dishes. I have not had a bad experience. I have only ordered or dined, during the dinner hours. I do understand the mix reviews, but I have not had any major issues to complain or comment on. The service could be a little quicker, but having it fresh made to me has always been worth it. It is worth the try. Mario's is under NEW Ownership! Always friendly and accommodating to all his customers. Fast and prompt delivery service as well, always with a smile. The Pizza's are great, from the simple Cheese Pizza to the Works!  I and the family LOVE the in house made, Ranch Dressing, they really need to bottle and sell that stuff can never get enough !. The Caesar Salad is Wonderful, large and very tasty. I like the Italian Hoagies & Meatball Hoagies. My son always orders the Gyro and loves it. This is a must try for those living in the South Hills or anyone willing to travel for a great pizza & hoagie at a great price. The menu is huge with plenty to please any family member. Keep up the good work guys !!!! I love a good Gyro !  I like the Gyros at the Old village Grille. We usually eat in at the few tables available, but we also take out.  I prefer to eat in. Some Gyros don't travel well. They make a very good Gyro for the area. The meat is sliced  from the spit. The vegetables are always fresh. I have never had a bad Gyro from The Village Grille. They do offer coupon specials if you can find them. They do have lunch time specials as well. I like that they have a kids meal special that you can purchase for the little ones that can't eat a whole Gyro. You don't have to pay full price for the little ones that don't eat much other than the meat.  I think the prices are very reasonable for what you receive. Next time I would like to try the Greek Salad w added Gyro meat. The Sushi Hand Rolls the very best in Monroeville. I highly recommend the Pittsburgh, Philadelphia as well as the Rainbow rolls, they are fresh prepared by hand and your able to watch as they make them for you. Taipei also offers the best Asian food in the area. I have enjoyed the most of the Chicken dishes. My favorites being Chicken/Broccoli and Cashew. I am not a huge spicy dish lover, so curry is definitely out and can't comment. I have had family members order from the beef section and have never had anything negative to say.  Family owned and operated and always present in the restaurant. The service has always been consistently pleasant and accommodating. I have never had a disappointing dining experience here.  If you enjoy really good Asian food please try Taipei Tokyo it is well worth the trip. Huge Fan and Highly Recommend. We have been staying at The Grandview at Las Vegas for years. This is a real review of someone who has stayed and have had no issues with the resort. We do have timeshare and use RCI for exchange. I have no issue with the timeshare push that the people try to sell. It is excepted at EVERY resort you book. Be prepared to either go along with it if you have the time or just say NO.  I just politely say NO. We own two timeshares and went through that hell of 2 1/2 hours and won't repeat it. They do accept the word NO, you just have to say it. I don't pick up the phone in my room. I disconnect it. I like it better that way, peace and quiet. The deals and offers that they make are not that great, so you're not missing out on anything.  I have been to Lucca only for lunch. It is always a wonderful afternoon. Great atmosphere and I have always enjoyed the relaxing visit with friends. The food is fantastic - Authentic Italian. I would highly recommend any of the pasta dishes. Their menu does change, but your sure to find any dish well worth the visit. I am always disappointed when a restaurant doesn't add the wine list to their website. Lucca has a well balances list that will complement any food choice. I am more of a white wine drinker. The Spaghettini or the Fettuccine with a good Chardonnay would make an excellent choice. I like any of the salads with added chicken.  They do have a great list if your someone who enjoys a glass or bottle with your meal.  I have always loved my trips to Vegas. Since we have timeshare we don't get a chance to stay in the casino hotels any longer.  Years ago before timeshare we booked a room at the Luxor. The price was perfect for a long weekend visit. We enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. We only had the room to sleep and change our clothes. I have nothing negative to say. The room was clean and comfortable and I slept well. We stayed in the tower on a high floor with a great view. I loved the Egyptian decor. We had very easy check in and check out with friendly service. I can't comment on the food because we eat elsewhere on the strip. I highly recommend this hotel and would to all family and friends. This quaint little authentic old world Italian, out of the way, Gem of a restaurant in Shadyside on Copeland Street, is by far the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. With  excellent food and service, you can't help but fall in love with this place as I have. \"Family of pizza lovers. We have met our daughter several times at this location, when she was working at the mall, during her lunch break. She no longer works at the mall so we don't have a change to visit as much as we used too.  This location has always been busy. I suggest getting there early and expect to wait in a short line, because they do not take reservations. For being here several times, I find nothing impressive nor disappointing, average experience at best. We order mostly pizza and salad. We do love the crispy Mac-Cheese appetizer. It was the first time we tried it and loved it, sadly every restaurant now offers it and makes it not a novelty any longer.  We have had the Pepperoni hand tossed pizza. We have ordered the \"\"Works\"\" as well; Italian Sausage As a family we have always loved Buca Di Beppo at any location. The food is great, the service has always been excellent, however, the wait time for food delivery and the final bill, keeps us remembering why we come and will we return.   Over all the experience of Buca Di Beppo is wonderful !! We love the family style dining and have made reservations for years for all occasions. The price isn't bad for what you receive as well as discounts and coupons are everywhere if you look for them.  My Girlfriend suggested this place because it was associated with Mazzotta Winery. We had a wine tasting, which will be in another post and decided to purchase a bottle to take downstairs to the pizza shop for dinner. It was an excellent bottle of wine to complement a great Spinach & Chicken Pizza. White sauce, grilled chicken, bacon, spinach, tomato and chesses make this a excellent choice for a dinner pizza with wine and a side house salad. Service was friendly and quick. We sat in front of the window on a sunny evening and enjoyed our dinner. Highly recommend, eating in. The dining room is large enough to accommodate any size party. I know that she has returned several times with family and friends. We are planning another pizza dinner there soon. We ate at the Grand View Buffet years ago when it first opened, it was really simple, plan, yet very good.  What a unique way to serve fast food pizza! I would choice this over any of the fast food chains in the area hands down!  A Healthier build your own pizza! GOT A LOVE IT!  I just LOVE Peace LOVE & Little Donuts.  We have been to the Strip District location many times. I am very happy that the Monroeville location is much closer. I like watching them decorate the donuts right in front of me. The smell & taste are so worth the extra cost. A must try for any donut lover !!  I like bakery, baked goods, so much better then store bought. \"Vincent Pizza Park in Forest Hills is the home of the \"\"Vinnie Pie\"\" which has been a family staple for 30+ years. We have traveled the journey with the \"\"Vinnie Pie\"\" through good I love stopping here for a quick bit. The sandwiches are great! I like the inside dining area as well. It's a great place for gas, quick food and drinks ! Clean, friendly and fast.  Highly recommend his sheetz !! I have had lunch at Storms several times and dinner only once. It is a great lunch spot for business people and town shoppers that know where to find it. Storms is located on 4th street, in the basement of the Law & Finance Building.  I have been to this hospital many times as a visitor, this afternoon as a patient in need of the emergency room.  This park has changed over the years. I believe it has changed for the good. It is a shame that more people don't get a chance to sit and relax during the nicer days.  This location of Burlington might be the only shopping left in downtown Pittsburgh that I am aware of.  We have stopped at Uno's in the Waterfront, several times in the past. Dinner or lunch has always been a hit or miss.  Pasquale's Pizza in Penn Hills isn't a bad place to take the kids for a reasonably priced dinner. The kids love it. The service is great for the several times we have been there. The pizza is hot and served promptly. I like the can sodas, just enough for the little ones. The restaurant is clean and offers plenty of tables and seats for a family of four to six. For a chain pizza shop the prices are reasonable and the food isn't bad either. I have to comment on the restrooms - clean and safe for little ones. They offer coupons. The best summer and school picnic memories are the Potato Patch Fries. Who hasn't gone to Kennywood and not tried the fries?  You either love them or hate them, for me I am a LOVER. It is a must visit, when at the park. Thick hand-cut fries with the skins on, covered in a choice of toppings. The family love's their fries smothered in gravy. I prefer the garlic or season salt. Potato Patch Fries are a meal in itself.  First ones in the shop on a Tuesday morning.  I have been to several of the Five Guys locations in Pittsburgh. The best ever lunch at a Five Guys was in the Atlanta Airport. Less greasy then most I have ordered. The Monroeville location is the one that the family has frequent the most. The downtown location is great for a lunch break during family business lunch time.  I am a little bias because of a family member once was a Manager of the Five Guys restaurant group. He has since moved on to somewhere else in the food industry.  Just to update:  The dogs in the photo's are my two Daughter's puppies !! Those are the puppies that have need for The Dog Stop.. Just love them, they have taken such good care of them.  A friend and I purchased tickets to the Allegheny West Christmas House Tours in December of 2016, this past year. One of the brunch stops they suggested, was Lola Bistro. I am so glad we decided to go before our tour, what a wonderful addition to our day. Lola Bistro is a lovely intimate small bistro with 30 seats at the most. Michael and Yelena, served an excellent brunch menu for those taking the tour. The brunch was excellent ! Lola Bistro is truly a hidden gem on the North Side. We will definitely return next year for the tour as well as a special trip for dinner. Many have suggested the seven layer Russian Cake, I am so looking forward to trying. I would suggest making reservations. It is a limited menu, but so well worth it. I also like the fact that it is also a BYOB, that is becoming my favorite way to dine. I don't travel to the North Side often, but I will definitely make a trip just for dinner at Lola Bistro. \"We have always noticed the gyro food truck in front of  the Brew Gentlemen's Brewery in Braddock  traveling on our way to the Waterfront, and have always wanted to stop. They have not always been there, so check their site on facebook and Instagram to make sure they are before traveling and being disappointed as we have been several times.  WE LOVE GYRO\"\"s and will travel to get a really great one as many of my post Being of Scottish and English decent, we had to try The Pub Chip Shop. For years we would travel to find Scottish and English pub food. We do like Pipers Pub, and Clauddah. Finding good Scottish pastry is hard to find. The local Scottish bakery went out of business years ago. Traveling to the Highland Games each year for just the pastry was getting old. Our daughters are no longer Highland dancing. A drive to Ohio isn't always possible either for Scottish pastry. We did find the same vendor at the Highland Games is in Ohio. We do follow a Scottish Rock band - Seven Nations, but they don't always have a venue with Scottish food available. The Burns Dinner in Bethel Park isn't always on a night that we are able to attend. Okay making a long story short...  We LOVE The Pub Chip Shop. The serve and food was awesome !!  We ate in and also took some home with us to have on another day. Highly recommend !! I LOVE the Sausage Rolls, The Steak-Ale Pie and the Sheppard's Pie. The Fish/Chips was great. The Scottish Eggs are to die for. Repeat customers for sure. I am not a baker by no means. Finding a great bakery is always a plus. I worked for two bakeries in my younger years. Growing up with Italian family bakers, Moio's reminds me of my wonderful Italian Aunts who baked all those goodies as well ! We had Moio's design and bake a cake for our daughter's wedding. EXCELLENT !! so many complemented on the cake and we have referred many to the bakery. We had ordered several cookie trays as well for different occasions over the years. What I love the most is that you can get a piece of cake by the slice. One slice of HEAVEN!. White Pineapple with Raspberries slice of cake, is my favorite. Well worth getting a slice. We mix and match cake slices with each and every visit.  Moio's is a bit on the expensive side, but worth every penny if your welling to spend on great pastries. Yes there are other great bakeries still left in Pittsburgh, but Moio's is the Best in the East. Family owned always friendly and accommodating. HIGHLY Recommend a visit. I do love that Peace, Love and Little Donuts, has a closer store to me, but when visiting the strip it is still a must stop!  Best produce market in the Strip District  of Pittsburgh.  Simple Gourmet is truly a gem in Forest Hills. Julie the owner is such a wonderful person and I am so glad to see her shop do so well. She is friendly and caring with everyone she meets. The food is excellent. A simple sandwich, which can't be beat in any store or restaurant.  Food for Thought is a New York style deli, a little out of the way in Oakland on North Craig. It is close to my doctors office and I enjoy stopping when I have an appointment. I order the Corned Beef sandwich with a fruit salad every time. Great deli sandwich. I like eating in and having a change to sit and relax and catch up on the news on the TV or talk with the friendly staff.  I have never been disappointed. The homemade soups are great, especially the chicken noodle or chicken rice. Boars head is a great meat product, I like that you can order it from the deli as take home and avoid a trip to the grocery store. Food for Thought offers discount coupons in the entertainment books in the area if you can find them. Highly Recommend !! Lunch was really excellent today! In the past it has been hit or miss, but today, Perfect !!!  As a family we have never had a bad experience here. Everyone loves it! The food has always been fresh, hot and served to our liking.  I LOVE SUSHI ! Sushi & Rolls have Excellent sushi! I love watching them make the sushi for me. The Chicken Teriyaki from the kitchen is to die for. The very best Teriyaki I have ever tasted. Sweet and rich taste. This hidden little gem is located in the Oxford Building, Downtown in the food court, behind the escalators. It is so worth the trip or a stop on a day in town. Downtown workers don't miss this inexpensive, excellent lunch.  The owners are so friendly and a pleasure to talk with. Here at Sushi & Roll you will find fresh sushi, a clean and inviting eat in or take out dining experience. Highly recommend and support regularly when possible. After have a not so great meal, we stopped for dessert! The kids loved the ice cream vanilla cones. I really enjoyed my berry smoothie.  Trader Joe's on Penn Avenue, has been a great addition to the revitalization of East Liberty. Well stocked, friendly store that I always spend more than planned, but so well worth it. I love the Fearless Flyer Newsletter, so informative and gives me the sale prices and items. I have both the email addition and the postal mail, subscribe to both.  I like the produce section the most, always a good deal and value if you look for it. The fresh flower section is always so fresh and colorful. Yes there is a small negative that you must overcome, The parking. The parking is horrible, but it is not the fault of the grocery store, It would be nice if it sat on the end of the strip mall and parking was everywhere, but it is something we must contend with and many of us do. I like bringing my own bags, it adds to the experience and feeling of health and conservation. The staff has always been friendly and helpful each trip I make. I think that Trader Joe's in Pittsburgh should sell alcohol,( okay just wine)  to make it a one stop shop. From my prior post some will read that I am a huge Chinese, Japanese, Sushi, Hibachi LOVER."
MXE5dJEqzzfKDLEGkHbdVA,"I'm a fan of the BeerHive! This place typically has a great selection and does honeycombed samplers with samples large enough for sharing. Plenty of TV's to catch the game while in the Strip District. The place isn't incredibly large, so when I've been there with a group we haven't always been able to have a table, but there's usually enough space to gather and still feel like you have your own space. I love Point State Park! It's a great place to stop if you are not from Pittsburgh to take in the city views, cool off at the fountain or bike along the trail. I can't believe it took me this long to try Thai Hana. It's a great place for lunch in Oakland, especially with their lunch pricing. I had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was great! There is more seating in the place than I thought there would be, so it is nice for groups of 2 - 4. It may be more difficult for larger groups if you get there at noon, but at 11:15 I had my choice of tables. Let's be real - this is the fancy place on the Southside! I've been here several times for birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions. It's always been a good experience! In all my years in Oakland, I never wandered in here until recently I found a groupon and took a friend for lunch. The place is spacious with a bar and plenty of tables. The staff was very friendly and they have a very large menu. I went with the spicy crispy chicken meal and really enjoyed it! The flavor was fantastic and the portion size was enough for two lunches. I sampled my friend's tofu dish as well, and it was also very good. I don't hesitate to say FANTASTIC! I worked with Paul and Sarah to confirm a catering order (for a very large group) with very little time after our vendor canceled on us just before our event. They were not only great to work with but the coffee drinkers were over the top happy with the drinks!  Perfect location for students. With group and individual seating options in the heart of lower campus it is a good place for study sessions or meetings. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It's also great to know they support charitable causes, like the Pitt Pantry! This is such a great place! I have started to buy my gifts from Ten Thousand Villages because I love the items, the concept, and the volunteers! The variety of home decor, jewelry, kitchen items, and scarfs is all labeled with where it was made, as it supports countries and workers who traditionally are disenfranchised and not paid fairly for their goods. Well my Yelp friends, Yelp led me to Pirata and it didn't disappoint! The food had good flavor and it is unique to what else you can find downtown. Arriving at 11:45 for a Friday lunch was great timing as only a few other tables had been taken at that point. The staff was incredibly friendly and were ready to answer questions and make suggestions. Excellent work! I was thrilled with the fact that before even looking at our items she asked us when we needed it - as to provide a realistic service (not allowing us to go through the motions only to tell us it would take longer than needed). Luckily we had plenty of time and still got the alterations done in plenty of time for the event. The work was done expertly and at a reasonable price. Only reviewing the bar area - as we only had a glass of wine/ cocktail and an appetizer. The bar tender was lovely and willing to entertain making us 'different' drinks. The pork won-tons were ok, but I think i was just expecting less of a hunk of meat in them. All-in-all, a nice place for a little happy hour. Pipers brunch is great! I take out of town friends there for brunch frequently. Fun atmosphere and different food for the southside. A new(er) southside spot is a nice addition. There is a great selection on the menu and the happy hour prices are amazing! There are a variety of apps on the menu, and they are half priced during their happy hour to compliment a drink of the day and reduced wine / beer prices. I attended an event at Spirit and had a great time! The space is large enough for a decent size crowd downstairs, with plenty of seating and a very large bar area. The beer was cold and the food was good! I wasn't upstairs, but I've heard it is also a great event space as well.  Great spot for a work meeting or a Saturday morning tea! It's been almost 2 years since I've used Thick Bikes for a repair, but they were so helpful when I got my new(used) bike! The guys were so friendly and explained what repairs were needed and why. The repairs have held up and my bike was like brand new after visiting them. I'm loving Carmella's! Great atmosphere and a good variety of beer and wine on tap! Great space on Carson that doesn't have the college crowd. The cafe has been upgraded since I was last in the museum! I attended an evening event there and also stopped in for a coffee meeting mid-morning one day recently. The space is beautiful and the barista was very friendly! I went with tea - they had a very good selection - and the space is perfect for a meeting with 1 or many people.  What a fun place! Great concept of starter locations for small businesses. The major issue we had was deciding which place to buy from and what to get! The variety was amazing - and since Marty's has closed we were very pleased to see a nice breakfast / brunch spot available with seating options in the Strip! I love this place! What a great addition to Millvale! The owner is so welcoming and friendly, and her teas and food are both delicious and exciting.  A fun small business to check out! They have a great selection of CD's, records, DVDs, and VHS tapes! Prices range greatly - some times I'll find a gem for less than $2, sometimes I'll see exactly what I want but it will be $15. Supply and demand I presume! Cupka Joe is a great little coffee shop on Sarah Street. Full disclosure... I don't drink coffee! There are plenty of options between coffee, tea, smoothies, and baked goods.  This is a great little coffee shop in Lawrenceville with great people! I'm a tea drinker and the selection is very good loose leaf tea. The hot chocolate is a favorite of those I've gone with and others have said how good the coffee is too. There are a few outdoor tables on the sidewalk  to enjoy. The only downfall is the indoor seating is pretty limited so going to do work or read might be hit or miss. \"Tres Rios is a nice addition to the Southside! The place is larger than I expected, with both a bar area and the 'dining room area'. We went on one of the first weekends it was open and it was early on a Saturday night, there were still 4 - 5 other groups there so it was nice to see they are doing steady business. I was ready for higher prices from the other reviews, but for the margarita and the guac and chips, it was well worth it! The guac had great flavor and comes with two bowls, perfect for sharing! The spicy passionfruit margarita was perfect! I've been places where the \"\"spicy margaritas\"\" have no spice - this delivered!  \"In the words of yelp!, \"\"Whoohoo! As good as it gets!\"\" I always love going to the winery! We made our way here during Open Streets one Saturday afternoon and have been back several times for shows. The bartenders were very friendly as we tasted wine on the entry floor. Since we hadn't been there I really like Red Oak for a lunch time option in Oakland. It's usually quite busy, but really is worth the crowd for the food. Also, working here it never fails that I run into someone else from the Oakland workforce so it's always a fun space to catch up with people. My first visit here was a major success! The 'faster-food' model seems to be taking hold in Oakland, and Piada is a great addition. The line cooks / staff were all very friendly and it was clear that the chef was in training mode and was great to his staff members (something I pay attention to and appreciate when I see it).  Great spot hidden in the Southside! I had been there years ago and liked it and just returned for lunch. The downstairs has plenty of bar seating and several tables. Great beer selection and a full menu, with TVs at all angles so you can see the game no matter where you are sitting. Great place! We were able to get in before the crowd on a Sunday morning and had our choice of tables. The staff was very friendly and the food came in just a few minutes.  Great option for street tacos in Oakland. Part of the small grocery store, the Las Palmas tacos are a great dinner! I had 2 carnitas and the fix-it-yourself bar allowed for the salsa and toppings of your choice. If you like spice go for the roja salsa - it has a great kick! For both tacos it was $5, which is a filling and inexpensive dinner. This is where Yelp! needs to add a sixth star. I LOVE City Fresh Pasta and am sad that it took me this long to visit their location in Nova Place. The menu has expanded since their days in the (old) Pittsburgh Public Market and it made my ordering very difficult! Our group settled on a chicken taco, Cadillac Perogis, and an amazing mozzarella ravioli dish (I forget the actual name of the dish). The flavors that they are able to pull together in the dishes are really top notch.  LOVE IT! Both times I've been to Brew Gentlemen they had a great selection of beers... seriously, I'd say something for everyone. Being local, I love that they have their beers and a few extras on tap for lots of tasting. We did the tasters of almost everything on tap last time we were there, so we could decide what everyone liked for themselves. The atmosphere is awesome -- everyone is very laid back and friendly.  Jasmine is amazing! Her baked goods are just as gorgeous as they are delicious! The U Club is a great location for meetings and events on campus. I'm reviewing for the Cafe located on the first floor since it is open to the public! I think this is the best-kept coffee spot secret in Oakland. Because it is located within the U Club it is less crowded (almost always able to find a seat) and they have outdoor seating! The drinks are reasonably priced and the food / pastries always look delicious (although I haven't had them). I've taken to scheduling my meetings there since every other coffee spot in a few block radius is full to the brim during the academic year. Although this is a bit of a pricier option for Oakland, it's worth it! I've been here many times and have always left happy. Happy this place has come (and stayed) in Oakland! Stopped in today for the first time and the staff was extremely friendly!  The space is clean and offers plenty of seating. Every topping I could think of (except sour gummy worms) ;) were available and they had a great selection of chocolate, caramel, butterscotch and others. Neither of us tried, but the smoothie menu looked delicious as well.  The fire place is so great for cold Pittsburgh mornings! I enjoy the atmosphere weather studying, working, hosting meetings or catching up with friends it's a great cozy space. The drinks are a bit pricey, but its worth it supporting local business owners who are great community members. If you like sours this is your place! They have a great variety that range from hoppy to light and with their sampler options it is easy to find one that you love! I am so excited that Espresso a Mano moved onto Carson st! After reading about their recent opening I stopped by for a morning cup of tea and the staff was extra friendly.  I had tried to go to Gaucho once before, but since the lines tend to be long I never made it to the door. Yesterday we had the chance to get there for an early dinner... and I must say, it was worth the wait! We ordered five different items to share and I don't know which was the best! The chicken Empanadas (2 for $5) were a nice start - we paired them with the dipping sauces available for a little extra flavor. I've had good experiences at Urban Tap, ranging from brunch, to happy hour, and to a group birthday dinner. They have a strong beer selection and cheap PBRs! Tazza D'oro is fantastic! I worked with them for coffee catering and the ownership couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating! They have a great selection of hot beverages and always have a variety of baked goods. It is a great place to head on the weekend to get work done, but since it is the place to go - I typically run in to someone I know and end up getting to catch up with people as well! The seating is limited, so with more than 2 people it is a challenge to get space to sit during the busy times. Great spot right on Butler St. We stopped in after Art All Night and enjoyed a great sampler and a six-pack to go. The shop is welcoming, the downstairs drafts offer a great atmosphere, and the bottle selection is great! Doce is the best! My first time in I made the mistake of ordering flour instead of corn tortillas, luckily they made me try the corn because that makes all the difference!  The carnitas are delicious and the weekly specials can be great too!  This is my go-to place in the south side, dinner or late night.  \"Very happy with them - finding a place in the city is a bit challenging to trust, but I\"\"m glad I found Wahl's. After another repair place had damaged my car they were able to take my car right away and look to see what happened. I didn't require it back quickly An Oakland staple! I've heard great things about this place and oddly, in all my years in here I hadn't been there before today. I'm not typically a cheesesteak person, so I went with the turkey and cheese served hot. For $8 you get a very large sandwich and a side of fries so I had both lunch and dinner in one meal! I'm definitely a fan of Bill's! Located Downtown there are many options in the cultural district, so it took me quite a while to realize Bills was there - however, I'm glad I did. The space is beautiful and very open. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming from the moment I walked in the door. Definitely a fan! The appetizers and pizza were delicious, the atmosphere is trendy yet cozy, and the yuengling cans are only a dollar! Great spot for a later mid-week dinner, as they had plenty of availability. In early February a few flowers perk up the house! We stopped in to pick up a small bouquet and the friendly florist simply asked how much we wanted to spend and put together a beautiful arrangement for $10. The mixtures of greenery with white pink and purple flowers was beautiful on day one and surprisingly a week later they still look gorgeous! I love the new location! They were very busy (understandably) on Black Friday at 10am but after a short wait in the counter line we were seated upstairs and received our food after just a few minutes. We were all hungry so we ordered a piece of fig baklava from the counter to share before our meals arrived. The flavor was amazing! The piece was big enough for four of us to all enjoy. I've been using First Commonwealth for years and was happy to see the branch in the Southside. I rarely go inside, mostly use the ATM, but when it was time to refinance my mortgage the manager on staff at the time (I think she has since left) was very helpful and was able to get me a great rate! Bak'n is worth the wait! A few people have commented on the wait and food times which had me prepared. Going for the experience and being ok with taking longer I was ready for the bacon and good conversation. After putting in a reservation on the no-wait app, we still had to wait, but enjoyed a drink at the bar (luckily there were enough bar-seats for us) then made our way to the table. I was only at Riley's very briefly but had a good time! We stopped in for a beer before heading to an event and sat on the patio. The bartender was very friendly and the beer was reasonably priced. They were setting up for a film screening under their pavilion and had plenty of outdoor space. If I'm back in Carnegie, I would definitely stop back in for dinner some night! Love it! Great selection of fruits and veggies, wonderful employees, and the prices are great! I no longer shop anywhere else. Getting all the essentials and walking out spending an average of $25 - amazing! Such a fun little store. We were walking through Carnegie and came across the flying squirrel and popped in to see what they had. A very interesting mix of games housewares and gifts are on one side and candy and ice cream are part of the attached store.  Great addition to the South side! The spring rolls were fast and delicious. And the Pad Thai was great (a little heavy on the onions, but that's just me). The owners are wonderfully friendly as well! Great theater, with great events and a great staff! The lobby is beautiful, and the theater is spacious! I'm a big fan of Delanies! Great space to study and work -- and it is usually nice and quiet. They are a great community space, and feature art work and performers regularly. I don't drink coffee - but the tea and snacks are great. The staff are always welcoming, which is a great added benefit! I'm so sad I waited so long to try out the Pub Chip Shop! I had had their doughnuts in the past but never ventured in for an order from there menu... well, after going there on an early Sunday morning I told my friends how good it was so they sent me back for a takeout order that afternoon. Yes! Mixtape was a great venue for a nonprofit fundraiser I attended. The space is cozy and fun at the same time and the staff was very friendly. Who could resist giant jenga, board games, and great music. They are a very inclusive and welcoming business and I very much appreciated the signage that stated that all were welcome! We arrived in time to put in a food order and had a surprisingly good panini and a soft pretzel. (I say surprisingly, solely based on the fact that their grill is behind the bar and that usually isn't a great sign... they did this right though!) I was very pleased with our brief stay! I had won a certificate from a silent auction and decided to use the stay during a friend's visit from out of town. We checked in late in the evening and left early in the morning, but it was a nice place to meet up and it was helpful to have so many options for dinner on Carson Street. Tako made my day! We visited for the first time after a Pitt football game and were so excited by the options. We had the customized guac (great options for add-ins) and then shared both the chorizo and the pulled pork tacos. Both were great, but I went back for the pork! The meat was done very well.. plenty of flavor! I've been to the market square location a few times. Most recently I had a craft beer and the BBQ Pineapple pizza. They have a great beer selection on tap, alongside several mixed drink features. The food menu consists of a few apps, a selection of mac & cheese options, pizza, salads, and burgers (what they are known for). This location seems to be either super busy (big event days) or a nice mild busy. I was pleased to see the service in market square was much better than what I experienced recently in the Southside location. Waitress was very friendly and even though the pizza took a while she explained why and apologized... which is enough for me to relax and wait a few minutes longer. I happened in to Park Place Pub looking for a place with WiFi open past 7 on a Sunday night... and it worked out! When I first arrived there were only two other people there and it did take me walking up to the staff to be able to order a drink and my food. The bartender apologized noting that it was atypical service and I'll just assume that since it it was quiet they got distracted. With an amazing beer selection and bar games (pool & darts) this is a gem that I need to think about frequenting more often. They kitchen menu is decent, and while I haven't eaten there in years, I do recall enjoying the wings. I was meeting a friend for lunch and I don't eat sushi... but this place is awesome! For those of us who don't like sushi or even seafood they have a great bowl option that allows you to pick your protein, veggies, and sauces. I love the new space! It is great to see several of the businesses from the Public Market find their home in the Strip District. The renovations are beautiful and it is spacious enough that you could go with a group of people. Plenty of beers on tap to try and they have growlers, howlers, and big cans to take beer with you! What a gem in the Southside! This cozy little place has a great variety of vegan food that is local, healthy, AND delicious! I've visited a few times, and most recently had the Curry and the breakfast tacos (my sister and I shared) while the other two in our party shared the Peace Pizza and the Blackbean Wrap. Everything was a hit! Good taco truck in the heart of the strip! We had the carnita on a corn tortilla and it had good flavor. Instead of choosing American or Mexicano toppings alone, we asked for everything on it... that was the right call! The meat was tender and the hot sauce has a nice kick! Wow - this place is dangerous! The ice cream is awesome and the sweets look amazing! I hadn't been in this place until the Soup Tour and based on a small sample, I had to go back later that day! The Fat Heads ice cream was delish, perfect mix of ingredients and the bowl of it held 3 scoops for only $3! Plenty of ice cream for me. Loved it! We started with drinks at the downstairs bar for the group while we waited for our table. A pitcher of spicy margaritas, and orders chips and guac / queso, later (only about 20 min), we got the front table which sat all 8 of us! I love local breweries and this one is pretty high ranking when it comes to Pittsburgh! The space includes the bar area with several tables and bar stools, a deck area with a bench and 4 - 5 tables, and a great outdoors space that has always had a great food truck when I'm there. I have visited in both summer and winter and had a great time, but did miss the warmth of the outdoor space. On a very cold night they had a fire pit going which allowed us to sit outside for a while while waiting for our food.  I was cautious after reading other reviews, but this was a great option at Brew Gentlemen in Braddock! We ordered a chicken taco, a potato taco, the chicken quesadilla, and a chicken burrito. Interestingly enough, between the three of us we each had a different favorite. The burrito had potatoes in it - which was interesting at first but I really liked it! One friend thought the quesadillia was the best (which I loved too!), and the third one in our party loved the chicken taco (she likes less spice, so that is the way to go for you folks who don't enjoy all the flavors!) The potato taco felt very Pittsburgh! It was good, but because it was a little more bland I likely wouldn't get it again. I hadn't been to Crazy Mocha in quite a while, but I stopped in to use the wifi and warm up before a meeting further down Carson St. The barista was friendly and reminded me that with a mug you get a discount - I love when coffee shops to that! I am a hot tea drinker, so I can't comment on the quality of the beverages - but the hot tea is lovely! For coffee, studying / homework, and what appeared to be plenty of first dates Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut was non-stop busy the day I was there. I went to get some work done and avoid the rain and luckily was able to find a seat next to an electrical outlet.  Great addition to the Southside. We went there for happy hour, and despite being empty the place was amazing. Our service, food and drinks were fantastic. I've seen a few films here and have not been disappointed! Something about supporting the non-profit theaters in Pittsburgh feels great! They have a good selection and participate in the film festivals in town as well.  Such a great menu! I've been there with just one other person and once with my whole family. Everyone ordered something different, and everyone loved what they had! The Price Fixe brunch menu was delicious...I had to take about half of my meal home.. but it was just as good later when I could manage to eat again! I've been to the Benedum for several shows and have enjoyed it each time. The performances are very high quality and there are often still good seats for a mid-price range. The interior is beautiful and it's a great place to take guests from out of town! Staff has always been friendly and helpful as well. Delicious. Amazing. Fresh. Fantastic.  \"I'm always a fan of Cappy's! It's a tiny place so you have to hit it just right. The last time I went I stopped by looking for a place to grab a quick beer on a Sunday afternoon. The outdoor seating was empty so we were able to grab two seats and enjoy people watching on Walnut St. They have beer specials daily and that day had a \"\"mystery beer\"\" special. The service was friendly and quick!\" This place was quick and really tasty! We had a little over an hour during our layover in PHX and were looking for something small - the Breakfast Club was $7.95 but was very tasty! Egg, cheese, bacon, avocado, & mayo on an english muffin was pleasantly surprising (cant expect too much from fast food, right?) Great sandwich place! I love the make your own deli sandwiches and the buffalo chicken sub! They also have a fun bar area with samplers! During the warm weather the patio is a perfect location - it sits off of Carson so even during the crazy nights you are away from the drunks and can enjoy your dinner and a beer. LOVE IT! This place turned me on to Thai food and I haven't looked back!! I've used their catering for events and often do take-out for Friday nights in.  Definitely a fan! I'm not sure what took me so long to get there, but it was a perfect little place for happy hour drinks. It's small and cozy, so luckily we got there before the majority of people and had a great spot at the bar.  I love this theater! With ~300 seats it is spacious and comfy. The nonprofit theater is a great option for a night out in Regent Square. We had the chance to see Fences there, but I know most of the movies are usually classics or part of film festivals.  Such a great place on Carson Street! This BYOB Colombian restaurant has a good variety and tasty food. The guacamole has great flavor and is served with thin sliced fried plantains, we also ordered an arepa and had a tough decision as to which one to get. The pulled pork was delicious and was plenty enough for a full meal! Such a great little place on Carson Street! I walked in and was greeted by the owner, after learning about their business I was thrilled to buy some delicious chocolate and a hot tea and forced myself to not go for the cupcake as well. I have been a fan of OTB - they have decent bar food and good wraps. A nice beer list with $2 off happy hour draft beer! I love, love, LOVE, the Pittsburgh Public Market! The combination of great food, friendly people, delicious beer, and great items to purchase makes for a whole day of fun! This is a great community space that offers such a great place to take friends from out of town, family members, and go on a regular basis. I'd spend every weekend there if I could! I have to admit - every time I walk in here I think of Rumshakers... but it's a whole new world! Twelve is a perfect mix of good food, friendly staff, and solid deals during happy hour! The space has been renovated and is lookin' good! They recently added the outdoor sidewalk seating area on 13th Street - which is cute and big enough for a group to enjoy outdoor seating. Needing a place for a downtown meeting, Starbucks at the Westin was most convenient for the group. When I arrived I was surprised how spacious it was for a Starbucks inside of a hotel / office building. There are several tables, a bar seating area, and a space with four comfy chairs.  \"I tried out Zen for lunch and was pleased! After seeing the \"\"coming soon\"\" sign for so long I was ready for some noodles! I had the chicken yakisoba and ordered it spicy.  The noodles were delish and the chicken was well cooked. It wasn't spicy at all to me though.  Amazing! I've liked everything I've had from this bakery, including the raspberry tart (I've never liked raspberries before)! We got a variety of items for a party and while everything was good, the tart really won for me! I was super excited to visit Dancing Gnome, as I had heard great things from Sharpsburg people. The space was beautiful and all the patrons were friendly. We stopped in on a Saturday night to sample some beers and tried four different ones, mostly Pale Ales. We had a variety of beer drinkers there that night, so the reactions were mixed. Things were a little too hoppy for me, but others loved it. So it really will depend on your tastes. I was only here for a very quick late night bite after Art All Night. They were closing shortly but allowed us to come in for a taco and drink and it was a great way to cap off the night. The tacos were deliciously spicy (which I love). Not everyone in my group did though, so unfortunately it wasn't a great experience for the lesser spiced pallet.  I've attended several events at the location and it is absolutely beautiful! Although I didn't have the time to explore all of the artifacts it was wonderful to be surrounded by such amazing history during the events. The large auditorium was wonderful for the graduation I attended and the upstairs banquet space had a great layout, including a stage. I love City Theatre! The seating is intimate, regardless of which stage you see - and the shows are always fun. The volunteers and staff are friendly -- a great staple in the neighborhood! Always a good time! We've even ventured out of the river (kayaking) and up the hill to stop in for a bite to eat and a draft beer. I admit, I am not very adventurous when it comes to beverages. I drink black tea with honey in it, and not much else. But... I'm very glad I had a meeting scheduled here today! My colleague and I met and she guided me through the process. She highly recommended the boba and the woman behind the counter allowed me to try before I added it to my order. I went with the black tea, lemon flavor, no milk, lychee boba and it tasted like a delicious and fun Arnold Palmer that had the joy of the boba bursts! So, next time I go I may be more open to the other flavors... but, this kind was so good I might stick with it too!"
MVvWOlVgOfRAtP41-A-g2w,"Never has a name been so true to its mission of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.  We stopped by on a warm June night and enjoyed the cool mister covered patio.  TV's galore, a cheerful server and great bar food.  What more can you ask for? Lets see whats worse, purchasing a used car, trying to find the perfect mattress, or having your wisdom teeth extracted. Hmmmm. After walking out of a big box furniture store because the salesman was doing fuzzy number addition, I decided to try this place out.  It is located next to Starbucks so how bad could it be?  Upon entering the 60 degree showroom around noon on a Wednesday, the salesperson greeted me and did not do a hard sell.  So far so good.   The showroom was open and spacious, with the different type of mattresses color coded.  For example, orange banners on the mattress meant pillow top.  Sounds trivial but mattress shopping can be quit confusing.  After laying down and bouncing on a half dozen or so mattresses, I wheeled and dealed (not really, but I asked for a small discount and he obliged after a quick call to his manager) and purchased my mattress.  It was delivered about four hours later, with the delivery guys literally rolling out a red carpet and wearing double blue booties.  Mission Accomplished! Entering through large glass motif front doors, our hospital Medical Executive party of five and our medical staff lawyer were greeted by a number of well-dressed hostesses. One immediately notices how dark the bar and restaurant are.  Too dark for me.  The majority of the patrons were noted to be using their cell phones to read the menu. The menu is typical steakhouse with choices of steaks and seafood options. The appetizers were also very typical for a high end steakhouse: including tuna tartare, seared ahi, jumbo shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and shoe-string potatoes. The seating area including the tables, chairs and utensils are very upscale and remind you that you're in a fine dining establishment. The waiter, an assistant and the bus boy greet you politely and introduce themselves by first name. They have an extensive wine list as well as various bottled water options. We started off with the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous, slightly sweet, and came with horseradish, and cocktail sauce. They were presented over a bed of dry ice making for a very pleasant presentation. The tuna tartare comes out on stacked wonton chips and I believe microgreens.  It was OK. Nothing spectacular. The crab cakes were awful. The crust was extremely tough and peeled off the rest of the cake.  A knife was needed to cut it.  Flavor was nothing special.  \"Let me start by stating a plain and simple fact, \"\"I hate walking into banks.\"\"   Great local park near Chandler boulevard and the interstate 10 in Ahwatukee.  The park has a few BBQ pits, some covered verandas, a water feature ( only during the summer), a skateboard park, plenty of benches, and a large grassy play area with room for everyone.  Parents are everywhere, especially Fridays after school and Saturday / Sunday.  There is a bike loop ( albeit a boring one) that encircles the park and is about a mile long. \"I often hear the phrase \"\"let me take you to this restaurant Our gem of a grocery store in Ahwatukee where employees know your name and recognize your kids. It is always fun looking  for seasonal treats, and Halloween time is around the corner: pumpkin cereal, cake mix, cookies, etc. I cant think of a single reason to give this store anything less than 5 stars. I needed a tire rotation so I came back to this Discount Tires since it is very close to home. I had a negative experience in the past where I came for a tire rotation and they forgot to rotate the right side! This time, they marked the tires with a crayon so they wouldn't get them confused and everything went well. Simple solution and it seemed to work. Everyone was very friendly and courteous inside the store and I was in and out in less than 35 minutes. I  used their online appointment service and it seemed to work well. Arrived on time, actually early.  The part was replaced quickly. Another company had misdiagnosed the problem as the motherboard. Four stars for the price, and causing cosmetic scratches on the unit. Placing it on a towel during the repair would have prevented the scrapes.  Fun. Engaging. Rapid. Thoughtful. Intense. Team building.  Aggravating. Emotional highs. Emotional lows.  Frustrating. Awesome Exhilarating. Super Fast!! Yelp Review 100! This review is for Saturday July 5th. We have been reading the reviews and didn't believe them--- Great sushi in this location??? Cant be. Alas, the rolls, sashimi, children's bento box were all very fresh, tasty, not chewy nor fishy smell. Service was excellent, my water was filled three times!  Reasonably priced and not teeny bopperized like Ra Sushi. The ONLY small complaint, no milk for my six year old. I guess  that would taste gross anyway. Lets face it, skiing and all that is associated with it is pricey.  What I like about Ski Pro is they have the expensive latest items as well as less expensive last year items.  The sales team is  really helpful and available.  This is my go-to ski store in Phoenix. I usually dont like writing updates but today I was shocked to see  that they had Poke, in fact, three different types. I ended buying two pounds of the stuff. It was really good. The fish was soft and mostly buttery with very authentic spices.  Occasionally I would get a chewy piece, but who cares! The Chandler Costco is a heck of a lot closer than Hawaii! Having a business mail box here for seven years, I have always found this location to be clean, convenient, and super friendly, even if their prices are a bit higher. Wow, what a difference from my last review.  I was helped immediately. I cant remember her name but she helped me with a garbage disposal and RO system. Knowledgable about both.  I was in and out 10 minutes! Wife and I had the babysitter for about another hour on a Saturday night about a month ago so we decided to have a glass of wine.  It has been about three years since our last visit.  Were were greeted quickly, given ice cold water and enjoyed a great glass of Pinot in a nice large glasses.  There was also live music that was not too loud.  The server (?owner) checked on us often and was very friendly but not intrusive.  There were mostly couples and the place had a good mellow vibe.  I cant wait to go back  and try their food menu. I decided to give Nordstrom another chance after the manager of the shoe department personally responded to my one star Yelp review.   I heard they had Moscow Mule copper cups on sale-- and indeed they were prominently displayed at the entrance of the store.  Done deal! In and out in five minutes. Mercedes-Benz of Chandler has been my go to dealer for everything Mercedes. Unfortunately, my vehicle is not as reliable as a Honda so I am in and out of the service area quite often. They are a pleasure to work with and provide loaner vehicles that are always current and up-to-date. My service advisor, Kyle,always takes care of me and makes sure my car is fixed to my satisfaction. Luckily I have an extended warranty on my vehicle otherwise I would break the bank!  One nice perk,  Nice Hawaiian atmosphere that has a Pacific Island theme that is not cheesy.  Super friendly service. You order at the counter and the warm, fresh food is brought to your table.  During the meal, they came a few times to see if we needed anything else.   Food is fresh, well seasoned, healthy, consistent a made with pride.  Ordering was easy, cafeteria style and you place a number on you table.  The girl taking the order was friendly, professional, and offered us cups for water.  The wait for the food to be brought to the table was about 10-15 minus but worth it.   It has been a while since I gave a restaurant five stars- everything really has to come together.  The five stars rating is based on two visits six weeks apart.   My tenant calls me on a Sunday at 2:15pm about the a/c being broken and the temp today is a humid, rainy 110 degrees.  She is not happy, the indoor temp is already above 80 degrees. I called Scott at 2:30pm based on the YELP reviews.  Scott calls me at 3:55pm with the repair completed.  Happy tenant.  Happy owner.  Reasonable price.  FIVE STAR REVIEW!!! \"Real easy to make an appointment, their phone was answered by an actual person, and there was no \"\"push number one Typical Starbucks located in a Safeway. There  is virtually no wait at this location as opposed to the drive thru location about half a mile further down Chandler Blvd near the I-10 which generally has a 15-20 minute wait. I was able to use an old five dollar voucher that I found behind my desk-it must be at least two years old. Score!  My iced Americano with soy was as expected. This is quite the deal: two dollars plus tax for two soft cookies and ice cream made into a sandwich.  They have about a dozen differing types of ice cream and cookies.  Limited seating. A great treat if you are on Mill Ave. Nice little cafe right outside Nordstrom in the Chandler mall. I bit hectic because of the older mall clients,  but they do a good job with the foam on the specialty drinks.  I prefer soy milk, and Starbucks tends to just make the soy milk warm, not foamy.  There is a nice bar area to hang out and a more private table area in the back. The coffee tasted roasted, not burnt-- a huge plus. They were nice enough to provide the coffee notes on the Debut Espresso brand ( see attached photo). This hip japanese noodle / Ramen house is off the beaten path bear Mill Avenue and hard to find.  When you do find it, you will be happy. \"Little did I know that \"\"affogato\"\" is Italian for drowned.  All this time I thought it meant espresso poured over vanilla gelato or ice cream. How ignorant of me!  Note: This is a vegetarian restaurant.  The location is hard to find, but there are a lot of trees that have shade.  When I was inside, the first thing I saw was a bunch of birds in cages.  All the birds have names.  One of the birds have a name called Rush Limbered.  A lot of them are parakeets.  The parakeets have really cool names. Nothing wrong with hotel restetaunts, but they normally are not my cup of tea.  Gallo Blanco, however, breaks the mold. Greeted warmly by the hostess we were seated directly below a large fan. We asked to move, no problem, we were moved to our table of choice with a smile.  I was so glad I actually had time to try this authentic Punjabi Indian restaurant located on Apache Boulevard. Outside, they have a number of rickshaws which make excellent photo ops, as well as a Tandoori oven. Inside, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a small, quaint restaurant with about a dozen tables. It definitely has that mom-and-pop type of feel. The menu is expansive, had wine pairings in the margins, and their spice scale is from 1 to 10. We started off the meal with mango lassi (really creamy and refreshing) and complementary papadum. Instead of the usual brown tamarind or green cilantro chutney, they actually have a third chutney that will make you sweat and clear your sinuses with about two bites.  We decided to order two meat dishes and two veggie dishes, one of each would be super spicy and the rest would be mild so the whole family including the kids could enjoy. We ordered: chicken korma, tava sabji, lamb curry, palik kofta, a spiced veggie dish, and two types of Naan. Basmati rice was included. All the food was wonderfully spiced and well balanced. Our two spicy dishes, which we had requested a seven, was too mild. The chicken and lamb were extremely tender and broken apart with your fork.  This is the place to eat a quick, tasty, asian inspired meal, especially if you are in a time crunch before enjoying a show at the Gammage.  In and out in 60 minutes, if you do it right..... Flexible scheduling. Arrived on time. Completed work as promised. Pricing was fair. I would recommend. Talk about freaky fast! From the time I ordered to having both sandwiches, drinks and chips delivered in hand was approximally 10 minutes. I cannot believe it. This is about as convenient as you can ever wish for. Service was super friendly. Well worth the price for this speedy convenience. Came here based on fellow Yelpers reviews on a Sunday about an hour prior to the 2pm closing.  The place was packed, and I mean packed. All the tables were taken and the line was six deep.  The staff was extremely joyous and appeared to be enjoying the rush.  A staff member actually saved a table for us when one became available. The menu was easy to navigate and had something for everyone in my family. Previous reviews mentioned that the menu had lots  pork items, so we were prepared for slim pickings since were are a mostly vegetarian non pork eating (mainly personal reasons not religious) family.   However, there were plenty of items that fit the bill. My sons ordered and devoured the FIRST TIME (nutella, banana brulee) and the VANILLA BEAN CUSTARD with marinated strawberries and salted caramel.  My wife and I ordered the 13 MILE (Steadfast farm veggies plus French masala and buckweat crepes) and the BUCKWHEAT piquantee, mushroom ragout with horseradish havarti. The 13 Mile was surprisingly complex with French and South Indian flavors I certainly normally would not have made a crepe out of on my own, and the Buckwheat was savory, and had the right amount of cheese.  They brought out a granola sample that was light and house made with apricot slices ( fantastic) and also the House Brioche sampler which was too hard to eat-  about three times harder than an old crouton.  I am not sure what that was about. Came here because I have to attend an outdoor wedding reception in the evening in the Arizona winter.  Having no idea what to wear, the staff in the mens department immediately helped me narrow down my choices.  They also offered to alter the length of my pants in one hour knowing I was in a time crunch.  The shoe folks were equally helpful. Now that is service! Franco's, located in Old town Scottsdale, is the definition of an old-school Italian restaurant with authentic homemade Italian comfort food matched with very personable individualized service. Perhaps too kool for me, this place actually has really good food.  An eclectic crowd if twenty somethings and 30-40 year old hipsters, we were brought here by our friends who had recently imbibed in the seafood the previous evening.   Nice venue to catch a game during the Monsoon heat.  Plenty of close by parking.  Lots of food choices that are mediocre to high mediocre.  Fans are super mellow, good if you are rooting for the visiting team, bad if you are a D back supporter Time for youth football and a karate tournament. We quickly found cleats, sports back packs, sports shirts, pump needles, and replacement cue  tips. We were assisted by no less than four people.  Checking in on Yelp saved us 10 bucks!! Located in a typical strip mall, I've had this restaurant on my bookmark list for over a year.  It closes on weekends, making it difficult for me to visit. We arrived right after the lunch rush, and were greeted by two of the staff. The menu is small but appropriate for the type of establishment. It had falafel, shawarma, grape leaves, Mediterranean salad, and yogurt called Labni.  \"As other Yelpers have stated, the best description of this place is a \"\"Subway for Pizza\"\" with some gourmet toppings and a ready to eat pizza in about 10 minutes.  Apparently Coming here for the eight or ninth time for dinner, we knew the food would be fantastic, but more importantly, we were mentally prepared for poor service.  I have to admit, I was definitely the biggest naysayer when it came to trying out Topgolf. For some reason, I just assumed it would be like every other mini golf/driving range/ sports bar, and I always declined invitations to attend. How wrong I was! It should be noted,that I am reviewing top golf during a beautiful spring day on a Sunday afternoon. I have no idea how crowded it is in the evenings for the rest of the week.   Family owned restaurant with very large and safe parking lot. Inside, very clean, friendly staff, and easy to read chalkboard menu. Menu is very simple yet provides lots of choices. Chips, salsa, and food are brought to the table.  The salsa is the bomb!  Spicy, not to chunky, and compliments the lightly salted chips. Watch the noodle man make your noodles from a large plexiglass viewing area. Talk about delicious noodles with texture, chewiness, and your choice of six different cuts ranging from thick to thin to chunks.  Without the help of Yelp our party of 11 would never have entered this place.  Slightly intimidating because it is so authentic, one of my friends actually told the server he was lost about the menu and if she could  help him order.  Our jewel in the Desert, this place rocks.  I have been here during the day exploring the various gardens, in the cold of winter enjoying the Nochas de las Luminaria, and now, a wedding reception in the outdoor pavilion.  You really cant ask for a better venue. Surrounded be acres of desert foliage, this serene oasis provided the perfect background for the bride and groom. Started off the evening with a refreshing Cucumber Mule over ice in a copper cup. Next were the Cucumber Hummus Nachos, from which their menu description does no justice. Creativity with this dish earns them much respect in my book. The hummus had, I believe, caramelized onion, balsamic, and chunks of nuts. What an original idea.  Then came the  Apple Brochette on sliced french bread along with feta.  This dish was made to be enjoyed while sipping a glass of wine.  Two more appetizers were quickly consumed including Mediterranean tacos, and feta french fries.   The Italian Festival next door was providing classic old school Italian music while we enjoyed a fresh lunch on a beautiful Spring day in Old Town Scottsdale. The open air restaurant upstairs had live music and a nice vibe.  People! Are you guys nuts for not giving Uber five stars?? This is the most amazing service I've ever seen in my whole life. You can be anywhere anytime and call for any car and get picked up within minutes. Other than Amazon, I cannot think of any online application that has made my life so easy. If you have a problem with the driver with a low rating, you can easily cancel before your ride even picks you up. \"Four stars due to the generally very good but way too loud live music.  We were unable the hear the waitress or the other couple at our table.  Appetizer included very tender shrimp and fresh corn tortilla. The expensive guac was excellent as usual, but the roll up cart for the guac production would not fit in between the tables so we missed the \"\" show.\"\"  The drinks at the bar were fresh tasting and refreshing considering the 110 degree heat. My mole chicken was tender \"Easy massive parking lot.  Everyone greeted us with a smile and there were plenty of folks willing to help us.  My son decided his 2k dollar bedroom set we bought for him that was to last until college was \"\"too baby.\"\"  Lesson learned. The teen section of bedroom furniture had numerous choices and the perfect price point--- cheap.   \"Curbside check in at economy parking lot 4 was a breeze thanks to Blake.  Parking on floors 1-4 was full but there was plenty of parking on the higher floors and the elevators down to the sky tram were speedy. After that,  the wait for the sky tram was one minute.  We breezed through security and their new radio wave body scanner in a little over ten minutes, with the TSA officer being friendly and wishing us \"\" aloha\"\" since our destination was Kauai.  Restrooms were also clean and centrally located. A quick  bite to eat at the Pei Wei Really tasty coffee without the burnt bitter taste of Starbucks.  Staff super friendly without a barista attitude of Starbucks. Only downside is lack of locations. Tony came out and found a roof leak effecting my windows!!!  I fixed that first and had four HUGE windows replaced.  The location of the windows would have made any installer cringe--close to a hot tub and the other in a narrow alley way.  They never complained, were VERY clean in and out.  He said I would love the windows and I do!!  Seriously, they block the heat from coming in, do not allow the a/c from escaping, and dont require sun screens.  Totally worth it.  I am saving up to replace all the windows in the house now. We came here to ice skate and check out the Christmas lights.  \"I have been dying to try their breakfast taco ( aka burrito) ever since this BBQ joint opened its doors.  There are two ways to order, either go to the front register area and purchase a pre made taco, or go to the main ordering area and customize your taco.  If you are in a rush, definitely go with the pre-made tacos.  They taste fine and are warm.  If you have few minutes to kill, then order your custom taco and walk around, explore the \"\"interesting\"\" Texas\\/Nascar\\/gas station decor.  I ordered the brisket with potatoes Nice local bike store that is actually part of  a larger local bike chain.  I have purchased two bikes from them over the last three years.  They mostly have Giant brand bikes.  Service is very friendly. You can get a decent bike for 300-400 dollars.  They also do tune ups, install accessories, and appear to be very knowledgeable. \"Perfect for meetings where you need easy food.  Ordered Pizza online twice now with delayed delivery to suit my schedule.  No problem each time.  Pizza made correctly and  delivered on time.  Is it the best pizza--nope.  Easy to order, convenient, reliable, customizable--absolutely.  Sometime ease of convenience is worth more than taste.  Try getting fast delivery  or the correct order from the \"\"better pizza\"\" places.  I think not.\" Yelp really came through on this restaurant!   Interesting concept.  It seems like everyone is following the Subway model of ordering.  I have been here a few time, and know they have a solid product.   You write your selection on a pre printed paper, hand it to the counter person, and two minutes later you receive your toppings on a donut no more than 10 minutes old.  The donuts are too fresh to eat by hand.  Gooey, sloppy, soft, full of topping in the most decadent way, a fork and knife are needed.  Best poke in town. Although probably the only poke. Seriously, I recently had poke in Kauai at a top 100 yelp restaurant and this  actually compares favorably. It needs a touch less soy sauce though, and macadamia nuts not in any poke in Hawaii. Returns Phone calls quickly. YES This is my go to place in Ahwatukee mostly because they actually know what they are talking about concerning my hot tub.  They never try to over sell any item. In fact, they recommended baking soda once in order to raise my pH instead of buying their chemicals. Texted them because I had their cell number from a previous job and we quickly established an appointment for the next day. He texted me when he was on his way.  The issue was quickly diagnosed, and he even showed me the broken part that was clearly damaged. I dont know if the prices were high or low since I did not have time to shop around but to me the peace of mind is well worth it.  Third time using them and I would recommend. Our party of nine was promptly seated in the back room per our 6 pm reservation. Having never sat in the back room, I was pleasantly surprised at the wall art which consisted of vintage sports photos and eclectic items. Really really good fish service. Really clean tanks with healthy appearing fish. The fish area was well stocked with everything uou need; filters, food, plants, eyc, etc. We had TWO people helping us and they provided TONS of useful info for us fish tank rookies.  Even the checkout girl gave us helpful fish tank help. We will be back for sure! Nothing like a live band singing cover songs in a crowded Irish pub on a Saturday night.  Located in downtown Chandler, Murphys Law is the type of place everyone can enjoy.  There is so much going on inside: rows of empty Whiskey bottles, thousands of dollar bills personalized with a sharpy line the walls, live music, descent food, kool people of all ages, and more.  You can stand, sit, hang out at the bar, or even enjoy the weather in the outdoor patio. This outdoor shopping mall literally has it all. A grocery store, upscale shopping, entry level clothing stores, pizza, Asian food, make up stores, Cost Plus, Sur La Table, and on and on and on.  Parking is plentiful. Why am I ( a male heterosexual) writing a review for this craft store?  Well, how else am I going to decorate my man cave with my famous SF Giants Newspapers?  They did a kick ass job of mounting and framing them. They will also frame jerseys, baseballs, etc. The official temperature yesterday at dinner time was a record breaking 115.  Unofficially on my cars temperature  gauge: 118.  Our reservations for the outdoor back patio were appearing a bit foolish.  Would dinner become a sweat bath of uncomfortableness?? Upon entering the covered back patio that is surrounded by shade trees and bushes, the item one first notices is a large outdoor cooling fan.  ( see the below picture) THANK god!  The dinner temp was warm but very comfortable and a real welcome break from sitting and eating indoors.  Living in Phoenix since 1999, you WILL be stir crazy every August because the monsoon limits any outdoor activities.  Tempe has really developed the area, especially the last few years.  Depending on the time of the day, there is something to do for all age groups.  It is a stones throw to Tempe Beach park, parking is plentiful, and there is a nice variety of food with few chain restaurants.  At night, the bar scene is hopping full of ASU kids, keeping the vibe electric.  Gammage is within walking distance too. Three people asked me if i needed help within 60 seconds of entering the store. More importantly, they had the items i needed, unlike Lowes. It was really easy to sign up for lessons through Sunsational Swim School.  We were quickly paired up with Hannah who was very flexible with times and locations which was a huge help! I like fast cars and faster jet planes!   This review is for Barrett Jackson 2016. Boba-- the kool drink currently taking over LA is now growing strong in the Valley of the Sun. For the uninitiated, boba is a 1-2cm tapioca ball that is added to chilled tea beverages.  It is drunk through an unusually large diameter straw with your beverage, then chewed.  Initially for the uninitiated, it is a bit odd.  After downing a few and choosing your favorite flavors, you will soon be dreaming of these.  The place to go for all your German auto needs. Josh in service was professional, courteous and was able to diagnose my auto issue.  They also have an excellent pre owned car selection.  I highly recommend. We came here to buy our new favorite rum from Kauai, which we imbibed in perhaps a bit too much during out recent vacation in paradise.  Unfortunately, they had every rum imaginable except for out new favorite rum from Kauai.  On the plus side, we were able to stock up on our red and white wine. Service, as usual was helpful. We also decided to buy ice buckets- you can never have enough ice buckets for parties. \"After having dinner at the China Magic Noodle House around the corner, I suggested to our group of eleven a \"\"field trip\"\" to Lee Lee International Supermarket.  Everyone looked at me as if I were crazy to even suggest we go check out the supermarket.  As soon as we entered \"36 falafel and 40 grape leaves to go, please.\"\"  That was my to-go order at 10:00 am.  They were ready at eleven and our middle eastern party was a success in large part to Haji Baba. This is my go to place for sumac \"Very convenient location with lots of parking.  Staff is very friendly and all do an excellent  job of styling hair per your request. Equipment appears clean snd well maintained. The \"\"MVP\"\" includes a hot towel How can you go wrong for five bucks.  The kids love it, there is never a wait, and its close by.  The pizza is consistent. I certainly can not complain about a five dollar pizza.  Why the high number of stars if the pizza is only ok?? Convenience, convenience, convenience. \"A buddy of mine were driving around when we happened to see Jason's deli. \"\"Hey Although I was unable to use their services, he called me promptly in reply to my YELP message the previous evening, and was very friendly.  Sound like he runs a tight ship and I would use him in the future. If you have wool carpets or wool throw rugs, this is your go-to company.  The vast majority of professional carpet cleaners in the valley wont even attempt cleaning wool because of the liability.  I had the nylon carpet in the basement, stairs, children's rooms, hallway, and office cleaned. Additionally, three wool throw carpets were cleaned.  Finally, our wall to wall wool carpet in the master was cleaned.  That was the carpet I am always very concerned about.   Five stars for the great service from three employees minus one point for the prices.  They were able to process my return with out a receipt which is always nice.  Fish looked healthy and the tanks were clean. Very convenient location and easy parking. Kool small joint, reminds me of the Mission District in my old San Fran hood.  Authentic street food. Cheap prices, strong salty Patron Margaritas. Insane horchata in  If you want to change the entire look of your home, change the front door. We went from a double wood entry to a custom iron and glass door that had our neighbors envious in the best of ways.  Four stars for the huge selection available TWO months before Halloween.  The seasonal staff is nice but obviously not up to speed because, well, they are seasonal. My two children and wife were able to find their entire Halloween costumes, while unfortunately they didnt have my size of Walking Dead shirts.  I was able to order my size online at the Spirit Halloween online store. Really a convenient option on the days that I am too tired to cook/clean up dinner for the kids.  The food is obviously healthy, fresh, and can be made your way.  There is a large variety of different proteins to go along with smoothies, cottage cheese, salads, salmon, eggs, etc.  A huge plus is they have soy milk.  If you workout early, breakfast is also available, and pretty wide ranging also with many choices.  Service is always super friendly.  The first thing you notice at NEW India Gate is not only the new location, but everything is literally new.  New plates, utensils, chairs, tables, menus.  You name it and it is new. Two knowledgable and loquacious brothers run the place.  They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers.  \"Wow! Where to begin.  I must admit this has been in my bookmarks list for over a year, but after I heard that this was a Top 100 2015 Open Table Restaurant in the ENTIRE United States, I Immediately made reservations for this past Saturday.   I was surprised to see only about 8 tables in total an a very small \"\" bar\"\" seating area.   As expected This is my third visit to Second Story, and this time I made sure to not drink any whiskey.  Why, you may ask?  Lets just say I am a slow metabolizer of this certain alcohol beverage and every time I come here, I have a great time.  Was it the whiskey or the service and food that produced such joy,  I would ask myself the next day.   This time I stuck to basic drinks with Tito, and I must say, this place is fabulous.   You get what you pay for.  We came here as a group of 11. Usually large group = poor service.  Not at this place! Francis, the manager had our outdoor table ready upon our arrival, just as promised.  He had the most patient server assigned to our table of three children and eight adults.  Seven appetizers, five beer flights, children's orders, various other drinks, and six entrées later, there was only one small mistake.  Service was attentive, curtious, and appreciated.  Cant wait to go back with just the wife and kids."
l7sZTLRUBK0k3xjRTj1CSA,"I had an awesome time at that bar!  Customer service exceeded expectations. Five stars for Levetto!  Enjoyed some good eats at this restaurant.  Oh my gosh, I love this sushi joint.  I went here in June 2014 and ordered take out and a juice. The juice was great - everythings made right in front of you. The service was good, the ladies working behind the counter knew what they were doing and were very pleasant to speak with. I ordered the BLT and kale chips. A bit too much mayo on the bun but that can easily be corrected next time. A bit on the pricier side of things but I will return. The caesar salad is to die for. I always want more.  A very peaceful & calming store inside a chaotic mall.  I come here about 2 times a week now for lunch and just love it! I adore the hot/cold options and have recently ventured to the cold prepared food section. I've sampled their samosas and they are just sooo delicious. They don't mind heating them up on site for lunch.  Loved Grazie!  Oh baby! Fatburger was too good. Previously known as Sakura Sushi, Maple Sushi has stepped up their game with new management, new ordering system and new menu items. Although I was a fan of Sakura to the bitter end, I do have to say they were in need of a pick me up.  A tiny hole in the wall restaurant with a totally under rated menu. Extremely easy on the wallet and very satisfying for the belly. I love the peanut sauce, the pad thai and especially their cashew chicken.  How can you not like a craft beer festival?! How can you not like a craft beer festival when sample tickets are a buck?!!? I've been to Cynthia's Paradise a couple of times and have yet to be disappointed in anything! So far, this is the only place I could get my date to enjoy that has any mention of the word sushi. There is something for everyone! Upon arrival, you are quickly seated and given an iPad to order from. The food comes out fast and hot & their sushi selection is great. You have your typical rolls and some very unusual, tasty rolls. Aside from sushi, we especially loved their bacon wrapped asparagus, the curry dishes and crab legs. Beer makes history better! Opening Hiccups Makimono was pretty decent! This place just keeps me coming back. Why! Why did this place have to close their doors?! It was so so good.  Nothing but good being shoveled into my mouth from Caldense bakery. Okay this store is just the sweetest thing. See what I did there? Because they sell sweets?... yeah okay. I do have to admit, I like this gym! This supermarket is where I discovered the caprese sandwich and I will never look back.  Visited this new establishment over lunch hour for take out. I love how fast their service is.  Are all cake pops raw?! I don't want to bash this location if it's a Starbucks thing but man, I won't be getting another one of these suckers. They are gross. 5 stars from me! I'm shocked that I'm the first to write this review for Sephora in Newmarket!? Much better experience today at AYCE lunch. Although pricey ($24 top n tax) flavour was good! Portions were big and rice wasn't too overbearing. Service was fast and this time they didn't need a supervisor to cash me out.  Calling all salmon lovers! I loved this little cheese shop. I went here for my 25th birthday and it was decent from the initial booking to the game play. I'm digging Zagros! There we go! Nice redemption, Cachet.  As I sit here in a food coma, I reflect on the flavours that have exploded. I really like this restaurant! Long story short - sweet pub, lively atmosphere, great food!  I came here one day in May with my parents for lunch and throughly enjoyed myself.  I have zero complaints about this franchise. Each time I order, I know what to expect, I know there's no hidden fees, I know the servers are polite and friendly (sometimes sassy but who doesn't love some sass) and the food will taste just right. I can't even begin to tell you what I've ordered here. Here's what I know and love; bruschetta, beer & cheddar soup, shrimp pad thai, chicken fingers, roadkill chicken sandwich, asiago chicken caesar salad, lettuce wraps, lobster & crab dip, just to name a few.  1/5 for service I really like this gym. I especially like that the hot water is HOT and that you have control over the temperature without having to continuously push a button at a present temp. Yes! I wish I had known this place existed earlier! Honestly, I'm giving this place a 5 star with zero regrets.  Beer, beer and more beer! Ughhhhh just so good! The rolls were decently sized. At one point I was concerned that my mouth wouldn't shut while chewing (thank goodness I was a loner in my car). Sushi Chef in Beeton is temporarily closed due a fire - so happy I found this place in lieu. I'm going five stars on this one! I have to start this review by saying that it's not as presentable as the other two Daybreaks in Newmarket. But, as we've all been taught, don't judge a book by its cover.  After spending the weekend in the east coast, my boyfriend and I were aching for some steak. We were going to try a different steak house but shied away because we wanted it done right; no trial runs. You can't go wrong with The Keg. Expectations are always met.  I went here while on the go for a bagel with lox cream cheese. It was delicious.  Delicious! Where do I start with this one? \"This company is an express internal and external car wash company located in Newmarket. I arrived on a Saturday and was terrified of the line up of cars I saw. There were about 6 cars ahead of me being cleaned in a first-come-first-served basis. I starred at the line up and thought \"\"what the heck am I doing here?! This is going to take hours!\"\". Well to my surprise Mmmm, it's just too good. The veggie poutine is where it's at! Their veggie gravy trumps the beef gravy any day. Too much bay leaf in the beef, veggie gravy is wayyyy better in flavour.  Best tzatziki around. I came here in March 2014 after seeing a play and I absolutely adored this place.  I'll definitely be coming back for some more wings! Mmmmmmmmm! Loved every. Single. Bite.  Wow! Huge huge improvements with this recent change in management. Travis is the man! Solid 4.5 from this girl. The bar is brighter and cleaner and livelier! Menu has made some wicked changes, too. I'm really diggin the Felix wings, the shrimp tacos & loaded frites. Close friends say the pork sliders were good, along with the new fries.  Five star for this location! I came here with Christina R and another coworker to celebrate a belated birthday. The service we received was friendly and genuine & our food came out promptly as we were the only ones there! The three of us ordered the mussels, and I had the chicken, beet and goat cheese salad. I have to say, the salad was kind of blah. It was just boring! I think it was the chicken because it was served a bit on the cooler side without much flavour. The cheese was also crumbled up a touch too small for me as I prefer larger chunks. BUT that is my preference so I won't hinder their rating. Favourite sushi spot in Newmarket, period. Mmmm, I want more! I can dig a place like Abruzzo!  Yup, this is definitely a 5 star in my books. Visited tonight for a quick bite and drink with a girlfriend.  I love love love Ricci's. Maybe it's because they spell my name right, or because they make substitutions with zero hassle, or maybe it's because their panzos are the size of an infant, who knows! All I know is I LOVE Ricci's.  I visited this location for my birthday dinner on a Saturday and had a fairly decent dining experience.  I think this Marshall's location deserves more credit. \"I had a really great lunch but my first thoughts were \"\"holy expensive!\"\" 4.5/5 I hold the Buttery real close and dearly to my heart. I adore this place immensely; from the food to the service and the price. Two big thumbs up.  Oh baby, this place is wicked good.  I adore this location. The staff are extremely helpful and super friendly. Same prices as everywhere else but the customer service is phenomenal. I will 100% return to this location. Not bad for a carnivore. Not too shabby at all! I absolutely adore this restaurant. I am always coming here with my coworkers for post work drinks and dinner. I have zero complaints about the food. I usually opt for the specials because they are unique and not seen on the menu. When the specials don't appeal to me, I find myself going to the ol' faithful Margherta Pizza. The price is reasonable and the portions are large. My gripe? They cannot separate the bills, they haven't an ATM and the service is unpredictable. Service is a big thing when it comes to being a regular patron but because the food is amazing, I will give it a 4/5. Service wise, 3/5. Yep, I'm going there with a five star review!  I've always enjoyed Milestones. Thanks to a coworker, this place has turned into my go-to sushi resto in Vaughan for both pick up and dine in.  I dined here January 10th for a birthday and it was divine. We ordered the table side ceaser salad, steak Neptune & espresso/Irish coffee.  I really like this franchise!  I enjoyed my daddy-daughter date here last week, very much so.  I like this location! The staff were friendly the three times I've been, offering me free samples and helping me navigate through the store. I had a question about a certain flavour and if it would pair well with some booze for sangria. The rep was very helpful; she made suggestions to better suit my needs which I appreciated. Okay, so I just returned from my lunch outing and man am I impressed!  4.5 stars for Pho Fusion! Mmm, their patties are just so good. I haven't tried anything else yet but the service is always friendly and the patties are always fresh! Ughhhhh just so good! The rolls were decently sized. At one point I was concerned that my mouth wouldn't shut while chewing (thank goodness I was a loner in my car). Sushi Chef in Beeton is temporarily closed due a fire - so happy I found this place in lieu. Very decent breakfast place.  Beer makes history better! I love this Milestones!  In & out in under an hour! I do enjoy this sushi establishment. Although it is not AYCE, its quality and flavor are top notch. I usually opt for take out and have not been disappointed with the orders. It's hard to keep those crunchy rolls crunchy when ordering take out but some how, Sushi Sushi does it!  Came by The Muddy Waters for a beer and some wings and left satisfied.  Oh goodness gracious, I can't say enough about this restaurant.  I actually love their wings!  Whether it's deep fried or grilled, Big Bone BBQ never fails to impress me. I love the home-y feel when you walk in, the small yet always crowded seated area and the line out the door! It smells wonderful and tastes even better. I opt for the country club with a caesar salad. My boyfriend loves their fantasy burger (doctor's note required) and fries. The beans and coleslaw are a nice touch. The service for take out & dine in is great. Just expect a longer wait time during lunch and dinner hours.  Best pizza, hands down. The BEST pizza I've ever consumed, period. I am proud to say this little nonna and nonno pizza shop is in Newmarket. Even during all the Davis Drive construction, I am always back with a smile. Their sauce has something different to it - maybe nutmeg or cardamom. The dough is cooked perfectly and, my favourite part, the cheese is laid ontop of the toppings, making it nice and golden brown. 4 stars for food Who would have thought excellent customer service can come so early in the morning? This Cobs delivers it well.  I'm giving this place a 4 because the customer service was superb and the food was tasty."
ddZffVYvHsCIhylU5UG-dA,"We took mom here for dinner last night. It's a place we've been wanting to try for a while.   Fresh and Easy is my go to store when I need an item quickly, or if I am looking for prepared meals.  They have a nice selection of items like fajita, k-bobs, stuffed salmon, pork chops, etc. that you can grab, take home and cook.  I also like that many of the items are packaged for 2 people.  I don't have to worry about storing leftovers, and if we have guests, I just pick up double.  Both the employees and prices are friendly. \"What can I say?  B&Ns are fabulous.  We went in this one for the umpteenth time last Monday.  The \"\"Nook Girl\"\" was fun to talk to Okay, so I grew up thinking these places were dirty little places to dine.  I ate @ this location on New Year's morning thanks to a visiting friend, Jenny from SF.  She hearts WH.  Anyway, I was surprised at how clean it was, no fancy furniture, but clean booths and tables.  There were a lot of people waiting, but they moved people in / out efficiently.   Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert.  This is another Harkins Theater, but I really think they keep this one clean.  The lobby, the theaters and the restrooms always seem to be clean.  I like the stadium seating and the concession choices.   Oh, Bookman's...you clean up nice!!!   Drove thru this location at 11 am this morning.  Order taker was friendly and got my order totally correct.  Ordered the new Pick 2 for $4.99.  Got the Apple Pecan Salad and small Chili.  At the window, the staff was friendly, took my dinero, gave me the right change.  We have used Caveman Printing for our business cards and different types of stickers.  They are so friendly and extremely helpful here.    When we ordered our business cards, they emailed us a proof the very same day, we added some info and they were ready the very next day!  (all 1000 of them at a great price!)  We are looking into t-shirt screen printing next. This post office is located on Ray Road between Higley and Recker.  It is a small post office with most of the postal services you would need.  There are no automated services.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  There are plenty of P.O. Boxes and the building is open 24/7 to access the boxes. It really depends on which bands are playing.  When you go on a night that the teens are amuck, the security seems tighter, the staff a little more rude.  Otherwise, everyone was great the nights we have gone.  The bartenders have always been friendly and patient (since I can never make up my mind). This is the place my sister and I went to EVERY Saturday or Sunday to enjoy sister-time and some great food!  The coffee is amazing (they use Illy) and the food is always plentiful, hot, fresh and tastes like homemade.  I love their scrambles: chile/tomato/bacon or tomato/turkey/ cheese.  They are served with a wheat french bread toast, but I get rye instead.  Try the cinnamon roll - even if just once!  Between 2 breakfasts and coffee we usually get out of there around $20. Another great meal @dos!  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  I thank the Taco Gods when I walk in the door because they have every kind of taco you could crave!  The Mexican Crockpot cracks me up.  yummy pork served with chips.  Wonderful in a tortilla! We stopped by here on our way to see a movie last night at San Tan Mall.  It is on the corner over near Macy's.  It is a cute little shop that offers cupcakes, cakes, coffee, hot chocolate and hot tea.  There is seating inside and out.   I almost changed my mind about eating here for my birthday after reading some reviews.  Boy, am I glad we went anyway.  The view alone was terrific, and the service was delightful.  The restaurant is located on the 50th floor of the Rio Hotel.  It is decorated in contemporary western art such as the giant metal t-bone hanging on the wall next to the host counter. I saw the traveling exhibit in Phoenix about 5 years ago, and there were some differences with this exhibit (some good, some not so good).   I have shopped at this location before, but this time I am rating the optical department.  Dr. Anh Tieu is very friendly, professional and gives you all the information you need to take proper care of your eyes.   How can you say anything bad about Texas Roadhouse?  You just CAN'T!  They are one chain restaurant that you can rely on to be delicious no matter what location you visit.  Let's talk about the location here in Gilbert, AZ. South Point Hotel and Casino has a variety of places to eat.  This one serves seafood fare and everything we ate here was delicious.  This is a newer location near my house.  The guys were pretty friendly, and I like this location because they pump your gas for you.  The gas is very cheap when you purchase a car wash!  I filled up my SUV for $35 today and paid $18 for car wash that included vacuum, armor all inside and on wheel walls, windows, etc, the works.  The vanilla scent is nice, too.  Yay!  Still a fan after going this past week!  We purchased a certificate from Restaurant.com and got $50 certificate for $10.  You had to spend $100 on food, but that was easy with 5 people.   This is an awesome venue for concerts.  We went to the Metal event held on Friday December 17th.  Several great Metal bands played.  Plenty of parking in the private lot. Located inside the Talking Stick Resort, this cigar and martini lounge offers a wide range of seating indoors and outdoors.  There are a couple flat screens scattered throughout and a fully stocked bar.  This was my first time painting something other than a wall. LOL. I booked with a couple friends and the online registration system was easy.  We've stayed at South Point several times over the years and find it is just as nice as it was when it opened.  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, as well as large.  Whether you get a king or 2 queen beds, there is tons of room to spread out.   We stopped in here the day before our wedding with my sister and her husband.  We enjoyed a relaxing couple of hours on the leather furniture while the husbands enjoyed a hand rolled cigar.  We watched the torcedor roll and box press some fresh cigars.   Honestly, this place still scares me.  There are so many products I don't know where to start.  I enter a Sephora whenever I am @ the mall reluctantly in order to get comfortable with the layout and product.  Kind of like the new kid in school.   i had the total opposite experience with this David's bridal.  I made an appointment to find a dress and scheduled one for my sister to find a bridesmaid dress.  i didn't have high hopes after reading other David's Bridal reviews, so I thought I would use this time to try on dresses to see what styles look good on me.  I needed to find someone who could repair a fountain and fire pit in my back yard since the original company who built it completely did it wrong.  The wiring was dangerous on the fountain, the pump and lighting didn't work and the fireplace was a mess and didn't work at all. We used to ride our Harleys up here and grab a burger and a beer.  We returned recently to show my sister and husband this neat little place hidden up in Cave Creek area.   M and I have eaten at this location a few times.  The employees are always friendly, and the food comes out hot.  The location shares a parking lot with a large strip shopping center, so there is plenty of parking.  It gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  If you are with a larger party, expect to wait for a table.  2's and 4's seem to get seated pretty quickly. \"Today, I fell in love with 75% off!  Bath and Body works has changed the looks of their bottles AGAIN.  So, we reap the benefits with old style bottles with perfectly good lotions, shower gels, body sprays @ 75% off!  That $9.50 lotion cost me a little over $2 today!  This is a \"\"while supplies last\"\" kind of sale.  This was one of our favorite places to eat wings when we were in the mood.  The restaurant always looked clean, and the menu was lengthy, so depending on what you are in the mood for, they probably have something close to ease those cravings.   Does YOUR church have a Starbucks?  Mine does!  CLM Weddings was suggested to us when we planned our wedding @ the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.  Christie contacted me and we began discussing what we imagined for our wedding day.  Honestly, I had not thought of things like chair covers because the chairs provided by the hotel were hideous metal and blue (my main wedding color was red rose).  Christie was hired as a day of planner, but she definitely worked more than the wedding day.  \"Ok - take this into consideration - dad was treating us to The Beatles LOVE, and not knowing any better, Googled \"\"the beatles show\"\".  Super psyched - my sister even bought an outfit for the occastion I have never been to a self-serve frozen yogurt place, and these babies are popping up like celebrities are having kids!  This place is my new drug and it's not called Charlie Sheen!  LOL! You can't find a better steak at a better price than TX Roadhouse!  I was so excited that a location opened up near my house.  The service is usually very good.   M brought us here for Easter brunch and yow-za!  I am a BIG fan of their food now!  We were seated pretty quickly for 10:45 am on a Sunday for a party of 7.  We ordered a variety of breakfast and lunch items which were all delicious.  No one walked away hungry.  It is in a weird, tucked away location, in the industrial area near the Holiday Inn off Country Club Rd and the 60 freeway. I use this location for all of my FedEx shipping.  I LOVE the staff!  Rhonda is so great and patient and knows everything!  There is a FedEx self service drop off and all the supplies you need to get your package sent off.  I LOVE this little cafe for the coffee and sandwiches.  We come to Vegas about once a month and usually stay at HRH.  They use Illy coffee, and I love it as a hot espresso, or the iced mocha.  Deeeee-licious! We came here the other night to watch some local bands.  The place is a little hard to find, but there is plenty of parking.  There was a couple of places open next to the Yucca: a smoke shop that carried a small selection of cigars and lots of head shop stuff, a pool hall of sorts, and then the Yucca itself.  Sprinkle, sprinkle, little dot...yummy cupcake hit the spot.  So, after living in socal for a couple years and eating these yummy cupcakes for special occasions (AKA when familia came to visit), I decided to take my sis here to have one.  The line @ the one we frequented in socal was always waaayyyyy out the door.  Today, there were about 4 people in front of us.  The other locations in CA were just as tiny, but at least one had outdoor seating to get immediate satisfaction of eating that sugary bit of heaven.   First: I am not a smoker.  However, since AZ has banned smoking in EVERY establishment where smoking might be enjoyed (ie. bars, night clubs) finding a spot where you can drink and smoke inside is a gold mine!   This Basha's location took over when Albertson's left several years ago.  This is my store of choice because it is the closest large grocery store to my home.  The store is clean, and there are many, many choices in every department.   This is my 3rd visit to Todd English and have had a GREAT experience every time.  It is my new go-to place when we visit.  It is LOUD, so get ready to shout over the tvs, music and rowdy crowd, especially at night. We stopped here for a late lunch today and there was plenty of seating considering today is the last Saturday before Christmas.  We sat in the dining area which was very nice and clean.  Our menus had stuff on them, though... ewwww... My parents treated the 6 of us to dinner @ Shula's Steakhouse last night.  We arrived @ 6:30 so the place was pretty slow, but picked up around 7:30 when all the tables were full.  The web site states reservations are required, and the dress is business casual.   OMG!  I can't believe I forgot my review of this place.  My sis and I were have a sister day, and we picked this place for lunch on Martin Luther King day.  I am assuming that is why it was dead, the courts and offices in downtown Chandler were closed.   As of this posting, it seems Casa Fuma is CLOSED.  There have been no signs of life at the shop in several weeks, Cliff hasn't been heard from on FB, and when we looked in tonight, all the cigars in the humidor are - hold your breath - GONE!   Thanks to some fabulous Yelp reviews, M and I decided to eat here last night.  I had some idea about how massive the menu is, but had no idea it was like a book!  We intended on going there for a salad, but were enticed by other food.   This is the closest Fry's grocery store where I live.  I used to go here every week with my sister, and was very happy with the selection and prices.  We found Chelsea's Kitchen on Yelp when looking for a place to have lunch on a Wednesday.  When we arrived, we were greeted with valet parking.  Inside, it was a busy lunch rush at noon, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  The menu is small, but the choices are incredible.   We ate here while waiting for our tire to be fixed across the street.  This place used to be The Vine for many years, until it closed and the building became two different restaurants.  We used our BB Yelp! app to find this place when we had a craving for some ice cream on this warm Feb day.  This place sounded interesting with it's weird flavors.  It is my new favorite ice cream shop.  \"We have been here twice now and absolutely LOVE the food!  We found it using Yelp mobile and it will be our Japanese \"\"go-to\"\" place.  The first time I had the Beef Udon noodle bowl.  The beef was a little sweet and the broth fantastic We went to our first PHX Coyotes hockey game here last week, and again yesterday.  Now that I remember, we had been to this stadium before for M's graduation ceremony.   Fox Cigar Bar is open for business!  The newly renovated shop has a large glass enclosed humidor, a large bar area with bar stools, and cigar accessory sales.  There are individual leather smoking chairs placed throughout the shop with plenty of ashtrays nearby.   My sis and I took the parental units to lunch yesterday, and dad was curious about this Mongolian Grill stuff.  This location is in the Supertarget shopping center in the corner by Radio Shack.  Parking close the location is limited, but the large parking lot for Target is right there.   M and I have eaten here many times over the years. We went back Thursday night so we could have dinner and then do some shopping in the mall. The menu has changed and I was sad to see the chicken and sweet potato risotto was gone from the menu. The free-range chicken they used was marvelous! We went here for my sister/husband 11th anniversary dinner.  First time for all of us.  The place is located in what looks like business buildings near Biltmore.  Parking is ample for evening dinner. We love to check out cigar lounges, and this was on the list to check out.  It is located in the big ole shopping center across from Toby Keith's and Bass Pro Shop.   Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  M brought be here for bfast one morning after he had his O experience with their humongous burritos.  I ordered the chorizo, potato, egg burrito and added cheese.  You can ask for a whole wheat tortilla as well.  M had the bacon, egg, cheese burrito and they chopped up the bacon, not like some places that use 2 long flimsy half cooked bacon strips in their burritos.  Plus our burritos were under $4 each! Three cheers for Sara who has done my cut and color for years!  The place is clean, has plenty of seating and accepts walk-ins. They sell high quality product and are the friendliest ladies! The Good Egg restaurants are always hot spots for weekend morning breakfast.  We decided to go Sunday around 11:30 and had about a 1/2 hour wait.  It is always worth the wait! I stopped at the drive-thru to grab a bite to take back to the office yesterday.  Sonic's are different everywhere I go.  This one has a drive thru, but there is no payment/ pick up window.  They bring it to the curb.   Holy frijole!  This place is amazing!  Growing up on the border there was so much excellent Mexican food that many places lack what we are used to. Looking for a good place to eat in the area, Yelp reviews led us here.  Food coma?  Ohhh  yes!  My sister and I went here for lunch today.  I thought she would be afraid of the Sharpie menu on the wall and low key tables/booths, but she was up for an adventure in delicious southern cooking.  The walls are covered by autographs of athletes, musicians, and others. Texas Roadhouse seems to have it down when it comes to consistency.  We ate here tonight with another couple and had the usual sirloin steak, mushrooms, sweet potato, and delicious rolls.  The service was friendly and timely.   Way to go, Joe!  You did it again!  We love Joe's family of restaurants, so why did we wait so long to try the Coffee Shop?  Well, we finally did, and that's what counts.  Now my quad of Eating at Joe's is complete.  Had breakfast here with the parental units the other day.  Called ahead seating at 8:30 to be there at 10:30.  Good idea because it was very busy when we got there.  We waited about 5 minutes for our table.  The place is bigger than it looks and there is a whole parking lot for parking.  Although there wasn't enough handicap parking for my dad's taste.   You can't get any better than $2.95 special plates during happy hour!  The menu is small for happy hour, but the food is AMAZING !   This branch is located near my house, so I frequent it for payroll and my own deposits.  The staff is friendly and the drive thru is quick.  It is a convenient location for me to do business.   Cigar King has the LARGEST selection of cigars in the valley!  Inside their store are 2 huge rooms with shelf after shelf of cigars from every manufacturer you can think of .  They even have their own branded cigars made by fabulous cigar manufacturers.   A night out eating delicious Barivian (German) fare, beer, loud oompah music, shot spankings...  That is what we call fun!  Came here with the padres March 2010, since they went to the original in Munich.   This place is horrible!  First, I was forced into the Relaxation Room where I had to put my hands into this hot paraffin wax and wrapped in plastic and mittens.  Then I had to sit in this amazing massage chair that made me nice and relaxed.  I giggled to myself that the only thing that would make this better is some wine and binge watching television.  Went to GB in Tempe once years ago, was happy to find them in my neighborhood.  M and I went there before a movie and sat in the bar.  What is up with kids in the BAR?!?!?!?   We went here the other night with the padres.  My mom has been wanted to try this place.  It is like other all you can eat salad buffet type places.  The employees were friendly, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  It cost $50 for 4 adults.  Guess I will be looking for the buy one get one free coupons. OMG!  Finding this place was a fluke. Wasn't looking for this particular food, but wanted lunch in the area. We enjoyed fabulous Scotch eggs and some Guinness and then swapped half Roast Dinner pasty filled with house made roast beef, carrot, Brussels sprouts, and potato with M's meat and cheese that was filled with 2 types of sausages. I have to go back and try the chicken pot pie pasty and some of those desserts!!  Yes, five stars.  Everything from the friendly greeting @ the door, the food, the service, the cleanliness, was impeccable. This was my 2nd time going through this exhibit and I was AMAZED AGAIN.  There are so many artifacts from the ship and the stories of people traveling are amazing!   Blue 32 has a really great atmosphere and terrific menu.  The menu has everything from soup and salads to sandwiches to pasta.  There is a great beer selection, and happy hour/reverse happy hour in the bar.  They even serve a late night menu in the bar when many places are closed during the week.  We stopped over to the Silverton Casino to see the mermaid in the aquarium.  We got a player's club card and got $5 free slot play and a free buffet.  We had the Saturday brunch which came complete with champagne.   Thought I bragged about this restaurant before.  Guess not.  Everytime we stay at HRH, this is our go to restarurant.  I love the chicken noodle soup, poached eggs w/ corned beef hash, and the Creme Brulee Oatmeal (which is served with golden raisens, milk and brown sugar.  Only thru 11 am each day.) With sandwiches under 400 calories, and stellar service, there is everything to love about Chick-fil-a.  This location is very clean and the employees are very kind.  We have even had employees come by and ask how our meal was or offer to refill our drinks. A friend took us here for late night dining.  After 9 pm the bar offers a $5 menu which includes drinks, appetizers and entrees for $5 each.  He ordered us the fresh made guacamole, the queso fundido and the carnitas tacos.  We had $2 dos XX pints.   Had another GREAT day at Dos.  Went with sister, husband, and my husband.  We noticed the menu is redone and the Mexican crock pot has said Adios!  Too bad.  The tacos are still very good and a great $2 price! I found him!  This is Lou's shop that was located on Priest Drive, and is now on Guadalupe.  We have taken my cars (plural) to this shop on several occasions and the employees have always been helpful and honest.  Whether it was for a quick oil change or some major overhaul, the guys @ this shop are always reliable.   Mojito Cigar Lounge located at 4705 E Carefree Hwy in Cave Creek, AZ in a beautiful strip shopping center.  The front of the house is a public lounge where you can sit and enjoy a good stogie and watch the game.  Back of the house is a member's only club that has monthly dues, and benefits such as personal storage lockers, bigger televisions, big comfy chairs, kitchenette, and poker table. My sister and I went there today for the Mystic Tan.  For $25 you stand in a booth and get an airbrushed tan.  The girl who took us into the private room was very sweet and explained the way to stand for each pass of the automated system.  However she didn't explain the usage of the lotion on our palms and nails so they wouldn't turn brown, too.   Aaahhh... nothing like the smell of plastic!  I was so excited that The Container Store came to AZ!  I had been to one in CA and loved all the storage options.   We had an impromptu Valentine's dinner here. We were headed to the movies and we were hungry.  You must know all they offer are salads, pizza and calzones.  They have a good wine selection ( a little on the pricey side).   Everytime we attempted to eat here in the past, we either came before they opened or on a day they were closed.  This trip to Vegas we scored! I am writing this review vicariously through my husband's experience.  When looking for a new dentist, I send him in first as guinea pig. This location is in a strip shopping center near University and Lindsey. It has been such a long time since I have eaten at any DQ.  This location is closer to my house, so we decided to go hit the drive thru after dinner tonight.   \"My sis and I stopped here for lunch Saturday around noon.  The restaurant was a little dead for a weekend, but this place gets jumpin' weekend evenings.  It has an \"\"outdoor\"\" patio which gives you a great view of the valet and parking lot.  (Ha Ha.)  There is also bar seating Went here last week to find they had TOTALLY remodeled the place.  Lookin' good Supercuts!  Peelers and spatulas and tongs, oh my!  Can you say kitchen gadget heaven?  I love going to Crate and Barrel to pa rouse the kitchen gadgets.  There are things there I don't even know how to use!!!   This branch of the Maricopa Public Library system is located at Perry High School and serves as a school library and public library. There are a variety of books, audiobooks, DVDs, Blu-rays, and CDs for adults, children and teens and a collection of large print. They have online resources such as ebooks, downloadable audiobooks, online magazines, databases for research and streaming movies and music.  \"We used this company for our wedding cake when we held our wedding at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.  It was poolside in October, so Dane suggested fondant.  We asked him for an old school \"\"tattoo\"\" style cake.  He came up with a fun double heart pattern.  The cake was absolutely delicious.  The BEST tasting cake I've ever eaten!  Even the fondant (of which I was never a fan) was tasty."
